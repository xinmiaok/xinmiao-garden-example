The Discussion section plays an important part in demonstrating to the audience of editor and reviewers that ==the contribution is new and significant==. 
- The Discussion section does this by ==contextualizing the main research findings== within accepted knowledge, 
- with emphasis on qualifying what is new and ==important by reference== to any limitations and by speculation about the greater implications of the new knowledge.

*讨论部分在向编辑和审稿人的观众展示这一贡献是新的和重要的方面发挥了重要作用。讨论部分通过在公认知识范围内==对主要研究结果进行背景分析==，强调通过参考==任何限制和对新知识的更大影响==的推测来确定哪些是新的和重要的。*

## 9.1 Important structural issue|重要结构问题

There are several important issues to think about as you begin to draft your Discussion section, or text that discusses results under other headings. (Although this chapter is framed around separate Discussion sections, the guidelines can be applied to discussion text wherever it appears.)

*在开始起草讨论部分或在其他标题下讨论结果的文本时，有几个重要问题需要考虑。（尽管本章围绕单独的讨论部分，但无论讨论文本出现在何处，指南都适用于讨论文本。）*

### Structure of the Discussion|讨论的结构

- Does the journal you are targeting allow the option of a combined Results/ Discussion section (or other combinations of content under self-chosen headings), followed by a separate Conclusion? Would this arrangement suit your story? 你的目标期刊是否允许选择结果/讨论组合部分（或自选标题下的其他内容组合），然后是单独的结论？这个安排适合你的故事吗？

- Does the journal permit a separate Conclusion section where the Discussion section is relatively long? Would your paper benefit from one? 期刊是否允许单独的结论部分，讨论部分相对较长？你的论文会从中受益吗？

- Does the journal publish Discussion sections which include subheadings? Would this option help you signal your main messages to the reader? (Do Task 9.1 now to further clarify this issue.)该杂志是否发布包含副标题的讨论部分？这个选项有助于你向读者传达你的主要信息吗？（现在执行任务9.1以进一步澄清此问题。）

### Relating the Discussion closely to the paper’s title|将讨论与论文标题紧密联系起来

- As you decide on the key elements of the paper’s story that will be emphasized in the Discussion, consider redrafting the title to reflect them more clearly.当你决定论文的关键要素时在讨论中将强调的故事中，考虑重新起草标题以更清楚地反映它们

### Relating the Discussion closely to the Introduction|将讨论与导言紧密联系起来

- Remember that you need to ensure that your Discussion connects clearly with the issues you raised in your Introduction, especially the country where you began (see Section 8.2), the evidence leading up to your Stage 3 gap or research niche, and your statement of purpose or main activity. When the first draft of the Discussion is ready, go back to the Introduction and check for a close fit. If necessary, redraft the Introduction to make sure the issues of importance in the Discussion appear there also.
- * 请记住，您需要确保您的讨论与您在引言中提出的问题有明确的联系，尤其是您开始的国家（见第8.2节）、导致您的第3阶段差距或研究利基的证据以及您的目的或主要活动声明。当讨论的初稿准备好后，请返回导言并检查是否完全匹配。如有必要，重新起草导言，以确保讨论中的重要问题也出现在导言中。
- However, it is not necessary to include in the Introduction all the literature that will be referred to in the Discussion. It is important not to repeat information unnecessarily in the two sections.
- * 然而，没有必要在导言中包含讨论中提及的所有文献。重要的是不要在这两个部分不必要地重复信息。

Task 9.1 Structures of Discussion sections任务9.1讨论部分的结构
Check the location of Discussion text in your selected PEA.检查所选PEA中讨论文本的位置
- Is there a single separate section called Discussion?是否有一个单独的部分叫做讨论？
- Does it include subheadings?它包括副标题吗？
- Does Discussion text appear under other subheadings?讨论文本是否出现在其他副标题下？
- Does the paper also have a separate section headed Conclusion(s) or similar?该论文是否也有一个标题为“结论”或类似的单独章节？

Now answer the same questions about your Selected Article (SA). Discuss your findings with a colleague or teacher if appropriate. Why do you think the authors chose the arrangement they did? Do you think the Discussion could have been improved by using a different arrangement?

现在回答关于您的选定文章（SA）的相同问题。如果合适，与同事或老师讨论您的发现。你认为作者为什么选择这样的安排？你认为通过使用不同的安排，讨论会可以得到改善吗？

## 9.2 Information elements to highlight the key messages|突出关键信息的信息要素

The types of information commonly included in Discussion sections are given below: this list can form a checklist for you as you write. You may not have something to say under every point in the list for every result you discuss, but it is worthwhile thinking about each element in turn as you draft the section.

讨论部分中通常包含的信息类型如下所示：此列表可作为您写作时的检查表。对于您讨论的每一个结果，您可能在列表中的每一点下都没有什么要说的，但在起草本节时，轮流考虑每个元素是值得的。

1 A ==reference== to the main purpose or hypothesis of the study, or a summary of the main activity of the study.
1呼应研究的主要目的或假设，或研究主要活动的摘要。

2 A restatement or review of the most important ==findings==,- generally in order of their significance, including
2重述或审查最重要的调查结果，通常按其重要性排序，包括
- a. whether they ==support== the original hypothesis, or how they contribute to the main activity of the study, to answering the research questions, or to meeting the research objectives; anda、 他们是否支持原始假设，或者他们如何为研究的主要活动、回答研究问题或实现研究目标做出贡献；和
- b. whether they ==agree with the findings== of other researchers.b、 他们是否同意其他研究人员的发现。

3 ==Explanations for the findings==, supported by references to relevant literature, and/or speculations about the findings, also supported by literature citation.3对发现的解释，并参考相关文献，和/或对发现的推测，也有文献引用支持。

4 Limitations of the study that restrict the extent to which the findings can be generalized beyond the study conditions.4==研究的局限性==限制了研究结果在研究条件之外的推广程度。

5 Implications of the study (generalizations from the results: what the results mean in the context of the broader field).5==研究的意义==（从结果中得出的结论：结果在更广泛的领域中意味着什么）。

6 ==Recommendations== for future research and/or practical applications (after Weissberg & Buker 1990).6未来研究和/或实际应用的==建议==（Weissberg&Buker 1990年之后）。

The elements numbered 2–5 are often repeated for each group of results that is discussed.对于所讨论的每组结果，编号为2-5的元素经常重复。

When drafting this section, it can be useful to think about the main points you want your reader to understand from the Discussion, and consider using subheadings or topic sentences to highlight where the discussion focuses on each of these points. Now complete Tasks 9.2, 9.3, and 9.4在起草本节时，不妨思考一下你希望读者从讨论中理解的要点，并考虑使用副标题或主题句来突出讨论集中于这些要点的地方。现在完成任务9.2、9.3和9.4

 ## 9.3 negotiating the strength of claims|协调主张的强度
 
For the last four information elements mentioned in Section 9.2, authors need to pay particular attention to ==the verbs they use to comment on their results==. The verbs carry much of the meaning about attitude to findings and strength of claim.

*对于第9.2节中提到的最后四个信息元素，作者需要特别注意他们用来评论结果的动词。这些动词包含了很多关于对发现的态度和主张的力量的含义。*

In sentences using that, authors have two opportunities to show how strong they want their claim to be:
*在使用该词的句子中，作者有两个机会表明他们希望自己的主张有多强烈：*

- in the choice of vocabulary and tense in ==the main verb==;主要动词的词汇和时态选择
- [x] in the choice of verb tense in the that clause.在该==从句==中动词时态的选择

Let us look at some example sentences from the Provided Example Articles (PEAs) (Table 9.1). The verb phrases of interest are underlined in the tabular presentations of Examples 1–5 below.

*让我们看看所提供的示例文章（PEA）中的一些示例语句（表9.1）。感兴趣的动词短语在下面示例1-5的表格演示中下划线。*

In Example 1 (Table 9.1), the main verb is in the present tense (indicating that it is “always true,” a very strong statement) and the meaning of the verb itself (demonstrate) is also strong; the verb in the that clause is also in the present tense.

*在示例1（表9.1）中，主动词是现在时（表示它“总是正确的”，这是一个很强的陈述），动词本身的意思（演示）也很强；那个从句中的动词也是现在时。*

demonstrate，证明；展示；论证
regulate
![[Pasted image 20221110110702.png]]

Together, these choices indicate that the authors are very confident of the claim they make in this sentence. That is, they think that the data they have presented in the article are strong enough to justify making the strongest possible statement about what the results mean.

*总之，这些选择表明，作者对他们在这句话中所作的主张非常有信心。也就是说，他们认为他们在文章中提供的数据足够有力，足以证明对结果意味着什么做出最有力的陈述。*

Example 3 (Table 9.1) is not as strong overall as the first two examples, because although the present tense is used in the main clause, indicate shows less strength of certainty than demonstrate; the verb in the that clause is in the future tense, indicating a strong prediction of outcome.

*例3（表9.1）总体上没有前两个例子那么强，因为尽管主句中使用了现在时，但表明的确定性不如证明的强；that从句中的动词是将来时，表示对结果的强烈预测。*

In Example 4 (Table 9.1), a much weaker verb is used in the main clause: appears (which is only ever used with the subject it in this kind of sentence). The verb in the that clause is in the present tense, reflecting the strength of the evidence the authors have presented earlier in the paragraph.

*在实施例4（表9.1），主句中使用了一个弱得多的动词：appears（在这类句子中只与主语it连用）。该子句中的动词为现在时，反映了作者在本段前面提出的证据的强度。*

In Example 5 (Table 9.1), the main clause verb suggests is again weak in terms of its level of certainty; in addition, the verb in the that clause has been made less definite by the use of the modal verb may. Thus, Example 4 makes the weakest claim of any of the sentences we have considered here. This is not a bad thing at all: the important thing for authors is that they match the strength of their sentences (using the vocabulary and tense options discussed above) with the strength of the data and arguments they have presented in the Results and Discussion sections of the paper.

This is a key feature that is checked by referees during review of a manuscript, and by thesis examiners as well. Now complete Task 9.5 to consolidate your learning.

在实施例5（表9.1），主句动词暗示的确定性水平再次较弱；此外，通过使用情态动词may，该子句中的动词变得不那么明确。因此，示例4是我们在这里考虑的任何句子中最薄弱的一个。这并不是一件坏事：对于作者来说，重要的是他们要将句子的强度（使用上面讨论的词汇和时态选项）与他们在论文的结果和讨论部分中提供的数据和论点的强度相匹配。

这是一个关键特征，在审稿过程中，裁判员和论文考官都会检查。现在完成任务9.5巩固你的学习。

![[Pasted image 20221117082221.png]]

An alternative construction without a that clause is also found in science writing.Look at the example below, taken from the PEA by Britton-Simmons and Abbott (2008).

*在科学写作中也可以找到一种没有该条款的替代结构。看看下面的例子，取自Britton Simmons和Abbott（2008）的PEA*

> Previous studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between propagule pressure and the establishment success of non-native species.

> 先前的研究表明繁殖压力与非本地物种的建立成功之间存在积极关系。

Task 9.6 Analysing and practising strength of claim 

Reread the Discussion section of your selected PEA and find sentences that use both these patterns in the Discussion or Conclusion sections. Identify the verbs that carry the strength-of-claim messages, and discuss your findings with a colleague or teacher, if appropriate.

*任务9.6分析和练习索赔的强度重读所选PEA的“讨论”部分，并在“讨论”或“结论”部分找到同时使用这两种模式的句子。识别带有索赔信息强度的动词，并与同事或老师讨论您的发现（如果合适）。*

Then consider your own results and begin to draft sentences to comment on them in your Discussion section, paying particular attention to matching the strength of your claim in your sentences to the strength of your data and arguments.

*然后考虑你自己的结果，开始起草句子，在“讨论”部分对其进行评论，特别注意将句子中的主张与数据和论点的强度相匹配。*

【练习】Conclusions 

Urban road widening is a common and effective way to improve existing old roads' level of service to meet current and future demands from society. Building demolition ==can== cause economic, environmental, and democratic issues, which hinder the road widening process. Reconstruction and expansion projects such as road widening ==should== be conducted ==based on the existing old projects==, which are suitable for employing as-is BIM. This paper proposes a novel approach to build as-is BIM models for an existing old road and its surrounding buildings using online map data without a field survey. ==Based on the road's as-is BIM model==, new BIM models ==can== be established for the newly widened road at the design stage. Useful information can be collected, analysed, calculated and stored as various attributes in the as-is BIM models and new BIM models. The road BIM models are detachable and consider road components in accordance with expressions in the field of road engineering. Then a clash detection can be conducted between the buildings' as-is BIM models and the road BIM models to estimate the potential buildings' demolition quantity and costs caused by the road widening.

城市道路拓宽是提高现有旧路服务水平以满足当前和未来社会需求的一种常见而有效的方法。建筑拆除会导致经济、环境和民主问题，阻碍道路拓宽进程。道路拓宽等改扩建项目应在现有旧项目的基础上进行，这些项目适合采用原样BIM。本文提出了一种新的方法，使用在线地图数据，无需实地调查。根据道路的现状BIM模型，可以在设计阶段为新拓宽的道路建立新的BIM模型。可以收集、分析、计算有用信息，并将其作为各种属性存储在现有BIM模型和新BIM模型中。道路BIM模型是可拆卸的，并根据道路工程领域的表达式考虑道路组件。然后，可以在建筑物的原样BIM模型和道路BIM模型之间进行碰撞检测，以估计道路拓宽可能导致的建筑物拆除数量和成本。
