There are many different ways to proceed towards preparing a manuscript for submission to a journal, but the process often seems to take a very long time and involve a considerable amount of back-tracking and reworking. Indeed, multiple drafts are a necessary part of manuscript writing – as co-authors make their respective contributions and the paper’s story is refined and strengthened – but it is in everyone’s interests to streamline the process as much as possible. Here, we present a possible set of steps for you to consider.

有许多不同的方法来准备提交给期刊的手稿，但这个过程往往需要很长时间，并且需要大量的回溯和返工。事实上，多稿写作是手稿写作的必要组成部分，因为共同作者各自做出贡献，论文的故事也得到了完善和加强，但尽可能简化流程符合每个人的利益。在这里，我们提出了一套可能的步骤供您考虑。

## 15.1 Initial preparation steps|初始准备步骤

1 Select a “package” of results that you think will make a paper. Collect the relevant data and discuss with your potential co-authors issues such as these:

1 .选择一组你认为可以成为论文的结果。收集相关数据，并与潜在合著者讨论以下问题:

- What are the take-home messages from these data (what story do the data tell)? 从这些数据中可以得到什么信息(这些数据讲述了什么故事)?
- Is this the best package of data to concentrate on? Should more data be included to strengthen the story, or should some data be removed to ensure that a single, coherent story can be told?这是最值得关注的数据包吗?是应该加入更多的数据来强化故事，还是应该删除一些数据以确保讲述一个单一的、连贯的故事?
- Who are the target audience for the paper, how significant is the story told by the data, and therefore which journal should be selected as the target? DD How will the work of preparing the manuscript be divided up (i.e. who will do what)?论文的目标受众是谁，数据讲述的故事有多重要，因此应该选择哪一份期刊作为目标?准备手稿的工作将如何分配(即谁将做什么)?
- Who will be listed as authors, and in what order will their names be shown? Who should be acknowledged for assistance? (It might be helpful to consult a source such as the website developed by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors for criteria to use in determining who qualifies as an author; www.icmje.org/ethical_1author.html.) 谁将被列为作者，他们的名字将以什么顺序显示?谁应该得到帮助?(参考国际医学期刊编辑委员会开发的网站，以确定谁有资格成为作者的标准，这可能是有帮助的;www.icmje.org/ethical_1author.html)。
- What timeline is feasible? At which stages will the co-authors read drafts? (Once a decision has been made about this issue, you can insert steps at relevant places in the list below that refer to responding to feedback from co-authors.)什么时间表是可行的?在哪个阶段共同作者会阅读草稿?(一旦做出了关于这个问题的决定，您可以在下面的列表的相关位置插入步骤，这些步骤涉及到对来自合著者的反馈的响应。)

 2 Give a short talk to a small group of your colleagues and present some background and reasons for the research (Stages 2 and 3 of the Introduction); the aims or hypothesis; an outline of key methods; all the data needed to tell the story (all the figures, tables, and other text); and a discussion of the results and their meaning. Ask the group to provide feedback on anything which was not clear in your presentation and any questions they have about the research.
 
 与一小群同事进行简短交谈，并介绍研究的背景和原因（导言的第2和第3阶段）；目标或假设；关键方法概述；讲述故事所需的所有数据（所有数字、表格和其他文本）；以及对结果及其意义的讨论。请小组就你的演讲中不清楚的内容以及他们对研究的任何问题提供反馈。

3 Obtain the Instructions to Contributors for the target journal and consider setting up a document template following the guidelines provided.获取目标期刊的《投稿指南》，并考虑根据指南建立文档模板。

4 Refine the tables and figures that present the data (following the journal’s guidelines). As part of this process, consider whether all the tables and figures are necessary to tell the story, and combine or delete as appropriate. Make sure the take-home message of each table and figure is clearly visible to a reader, and easy to identify from the text in the title or legend. Under each figure or table, write bullet points that capture the important message elements presented, and label each one R if the point will be written about in the Results section, and D if it will appear in the Discussion.

4完善呈现数据的表格和图表（遵循期刊指南）。作为这一过程的一部分，考虑是否需要所有的表格和数字来讲述故事，并酌情合并或删除。确保每个表和图的带回家的信息对读者清晰可见，并且易于从标题或图例中的文本中识别。在每个图或表下，写下捕获所呈现的重要信息元素的项目符号点，并标记每个项目符号点R（如果该点将在结果部分中写入），D（如果该点将出现在讨论中）。

5 Draft the Results section, highlighting the take-home messages.起草“结果”部分，突出重点信息。

6 Write bullet points on possible ideas to include in the Discussion.写下讨论中可能包含的观点要点。

7 Draft or refine the paper’s title to capture the paper’s main message.起草或修改论文标题，以捕捉论文的主要信息。

8 Draft the Methods section, or its equivalent.起草方法部分，或与其相当的部分。

9 Draft the Introduction. Consider writing the stages in the order 4, 3, 1, 2, with Stage 5 (if present) at the appropriate place for your particular story, and Stage 6 at the end if required (see Chapter 8 for details).起草引言。考虑按照4、3、1、2的顺序编写阶段，将阶段5(如果存在)放在故事的合适位置，如果需要，将阶段6放在最后(详见第8章)。

10 Draft the Discussion section, and the Conclusion if it is to be in a separate section.起草讨论部分，以及结论部分(如果要单独写在一个部分)。

11 Draft an Abstract/Summary.起草一份摘要/总结。

12 Draft a set of keywords.起草一组关键词。

13 Put all the pieces together to form a complete first draft.把所有的部分放在一起形成一个完整的初稿。

14 To refine your manuscript, follow the suggestions in Section 15.2.14要完善您的手稿，请遵循第15.2节中的建议。

## 15.2 Editing procedures|编辑步骤

1 Put the completed draft aside for a while. The literature on this topic suggests that you need at least 48 hours away from the draft before you can read what you actually wrote, as opposed to what you think you wrote.

1 把完成的草稿先放在一边。关于这个话题的文献表明，你至少需要48小时的时间才能阅读你实际写的内容，而不是你认为你写的内容。

2 When you come back to the document, print off a paper copy and read the document through from the beginning with the aim of identifying places where content changes are needed. Do not stop to make any changes; just put marks in the margin or under problem words to indicate the places you will need to return to later.

2 当你重新阅读文档时，打印一份纸质副本，从头到尾通读文档，以确定需要修改内容的地方。不要停下来做任何改变;只要在页边空白处或有问题的单词下面做上标记，指出你以后需要重读的地方。

3 Once you have reached the end of the document, go back to the beginning. Work on improving each problem you identified.当你读到文档的末尾，再回到开头。努力改进你发现的每个问题。

4 Then edit it again, as before.然后像以前一样重新编辑。

5 Do this as many times as necessary. When you have completed this part of the process, you should be satisfied with the science of what you have written.必要时尽量多做。当你完成了这个过程的这一部分，你应该对你所写的内容的科学性感到满意。

6 Now edit for so-called discourse features: these are the language features that contribute to the flow and linking of the sections and sentences.现在编辑所谓的篇章特征:这些语言特征有助于段落和句子的流畅和连接。
