审稿人评价稿件的标准

As discussed in Chapter 1, ==the first audience== for your manuscript is ==the editor of the journal== you have selected. 
- In recent years, with the advent of electronic submission by uploading files on a computer, 
- the very first audience may be ==a person== who checks that ==formatting and other requirements== have been met, 
	- but this fact does not alter the ==editor’s initial filtering role== in terms of the article’s content. 
- If the manuscript is judged suitable for reviewing (see Chapters 13 and 14 for more details of this process), 
	- the editor sends it to (usually) ==two peer reviewers or referees== for comment. 
		- These reviewers are probably working in the same field as the manuscript authors: 
			- perhaps their names are in the list of references of the manuscript. 
			- However, the reviewing process is “blind,” meaning that the manuscript authors do not know who reviews their paper. ([[Double-blind reviewing]], where the referees also do not know who authored the manuscript they are reviewing, is less commonly practised in the sciences.)

*正如第1章所讨论的，你手稿的第一个读者是你所选期刊的编辑。近年来，随着通过在计算机上上传文件进行电子提交的出现，第一批读者可能是检查格式和其他要求是否得到满足的人，但这一事实并不会改变编辑在文章内容方面的最初筛选角色。如果稿件被认为适合审阅（有关此过程的更多细节，请参见第13章和第14章），编辑会将稿件发送给（通常）两位同行审阅者或审稿人征求意见。这些审稿人可能与手稿作者在同一领域工作：也许他们的名字在手稿的参考文献列表中。然而，审查过程是“盲目的”，这意味着稿件作者不知道谁审查了他们的论文。（双盲评审在科学界不太常见，评审员也不知道他们正在评审的手稿是谁写的。）*

Each journal has its own set of ==instructions for reviewers==, and sometimes these are available ==on the journal’s website==. 
- You should check and see whether this is the case for the journal you are targeting, and obtain a copy if possible. 
- For the purposes of this book, we have constructed a composite list of reviewer criteria that includes the sorts of questions referees are commonly asked to respond to (Figure 3.1). 
	- In addition to “ticking the boxes” to provide yes/no answers to the questions, reviewers are asked to write their comments about any problems with the manuscript or any suggestions for improvement that need to be followed before the manuscript can be considered suitable for publication in the journal.

每种期刊都有自己的一套审稿人须知，有时可以在期刊的网站上找到。你应该检查一下，看看你的目标期刊是否是这样的，如果可能的话，获取一份副本。为了本书的目的，我们构建了一个评审标准的综合列表，其中包括了评审通常需要回答的问题类型（图3.1）。除了“打勾”以提供问题的是/否答案外，审稿人还被要求就稿件的任何问题或需要遵循的任何改进建议撰写评论，然后才能认为稿件适合在期刊上发表。
### novelty or quality
Increasingly, as the number of manuscripts submitted to journals has grown, reviewers are asked to give some numerical rating of ==the paper’s novelty or quality== as well (e.g. Does this manuscript fall within the top 20% of manuscripts you have read in the last 12 months?). Reviewers return their comments to the editor. To help you think more about these criteria, complete Task 3.1 now.

随着提交给期刊的稿件越来越多，审稿人也被要求对论文的新颖性或质量进行数字评分（例如，这篇稿件是否属于你在过去12个月内阅读的稿件的前20%？）。审稿人将评论返回给编辑。为了帮助您更多地考虑这些标准，现在就完成任务3.1。

As we discuss each section of a research article in detail, 当我们详细讨论研究文章的每一部分时，
- we will 我们将
	- keep these <u>reviewer criteria</u> in mind and 牢记这些审稿人标准，并
	- draw attention to ==the presentation features== and ==English expressions==  提请注意······的呈现特征和英语表达
		- that are commonly used to highlight the <u>fact</u>  通常用于突出······这一事实
			- that ==evidence relevant to <u>reviewer criteria</u>== is being presented. 与审稿人相关的证据正在呈现

提请注意通常用于突出与审稿人相关的证据正在呈现这一事实的呈现特征和英语表达。

We will begin by considering the question: Does the title clearly indicate the content of the paper?
我们将首先考虑以下问题：标题是否清楚地表明了论文的内容？

Task 3.1 审阅者会看哪里？

Read the list of questions in Figure 3.1. For each question, decide where in a manuscript a reviewer would expect to find evidence on which to base their answer. Write one or more of the following abbreviations beside each question: A, I, M, R, D, or Ref (meaning reference list). For example, for question 5 you would write M and R. Again, bear in mind that in an AIBC (Abstract, Introduction, Body sections, Conclusions) structure the elements M, R, and D may appear in sections with other names.

阅读图3.1中的问题列表。对于每一个问题，决定审稿人希望在手稿中的什么地方找到答案的依据。在每个问题旁边写一个或多个以下缩写：A、I、M、R、D或Ref（意思是参考列表）。例如，对于问题5，你可以写M和R。再次记住，在AIBC（摘要、引言、正文部分、结论）结构中，元素M、R和D可能会以其他名称出现在部分中。

## 3.1 Titles as content signposts|作为内容标志的标题

Good titles clearly identify the field of the research, indicate the “story” the results tell, and raise questions about the research in the mind of the reader. We will return to a more detailed consideration of titles in Chapter 10. For now, consider this example and then complete Task 3.2.

*好的标题清楚地指明了研究领域，指出了研究结果所讲述的“故事”，并在读者心中提出了有关研究的问题。我们将在第10章中更详细地讨论标题。现在，考虑这个例子，然后完成任务3.2。*

> Title: Bird use of rice field strips of varying width in the Kanto Plain of central Japan 标题：日本中部关东平原不同宽度稻田带的鸟类使用

Information: 信息：

The focus is on birds in relation to rice fields.重点是与稻田有关的鸟类。

The width of rice field strips was varied in the study.研究中稻田条带的宽度各不相同。

Width of strips was correlated with the number and species of birds using them.条纹的宽度与使用条纹的鸟类的数量和种类相关。

The research took place in central Japan.这项研究在日本中部进行。

Possible questions: Why was the width of the strips an important variable? Did the width of the rice field strips affect which birds used it? If so, which field strip width was used most by which birds? How did the researchers measure bird use? Would the experiment be worth repeating for rice field strips in other places?

*可能的问题：为什么条带的宽度是一个重要变量？稻田带的宽度是否影响了哪些鸟类使用稻田带？如果是这样的话，哪种鸟类使用最多的田地带宽度？研究人员如何测量鸟类的使用量？对于其他地方的稻田条，这个实验值得重复吗？*
