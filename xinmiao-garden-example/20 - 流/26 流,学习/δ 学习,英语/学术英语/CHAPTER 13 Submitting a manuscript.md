## 13.1 Five practices of successful authors|成功作者的五大实践

Success as a scientist is largely measured by the quality and quantity of research output and the impact of that research on other research or practice. Publishing scientific articles is a necessary part of success as a scientist. Successful authors adopt five practices to optimize their publication outcomes. They

科学家的成功很大程度上是由研究成果的质量和数量以及该研究对其他研究或实践的影响来衡量的。发表科学论文是科学家成功的必要组成部分。成功的作者采用五种方法来优化他们的出版结果。他们

1 review manuscripts for colleagues and journals and ==develop a strong framework== for research writing and manuscript critique; *为同事和期刊审阅稿件，为研究写作和稿件评论建立一个强有力的框架*
2 plan their research and writing to ==meet the quality assurance criteria== that reviewers and editors will impose; *计划他们的研究和写作，以满足审稿人和编辑将实施的质量保证标准*
3 carefully select the journal they will submit to and prepare the manuscript content and style to ==maximize their chances of acceptance==; 仔细选择投稿的期刊，准备稿件内容和风格，最大限度地提高被录用的机会
4 use structured review processes and pre-reviews from colleagues to ==improve the manuscript before submitting== it to a journal; and 在投稿前使用结构化的评审流程和同事的预评审来改进稿件
5 use journal referee reports to improve the manuscript and ==demonstrate== to the journal editor ==how improvements have been made==.使用期刊评审报告来改进稿件，并向期刊编辑演示如何改进。

## 13.2 Understanding the peer-review process|了解同行评议过程

A scientific research article does not produce truth or certainty but ==documents the observations/measurements, analysis, and interpretation of the authors in the context of previous research.== 

*一篇科学研究文章并不产生真理或确定性，而是记录了作者在以前的研究背景下的**观察/测量、分析和解释**。*

The ==veracity== of findings from a scientific study will be ==confirmed by subsequent research or application==, and may ==be qualified or amended over time==. The peer-review process assists the scientific community in ==assuring the quality of research== before it is published and before it can be examined and used by a wider audience.

*科学研究结果的==准确性==将通过后续的研究或应用得到确认，并可能随着时间的推移而被限定或修改。同行评议过程有助于科学界在研究成果发表和被更广泛的观众审查和使用之前确保其质量。*

Peer reviewing is part of the process of ==turning information into knowledge==. The correspondence between the author, reviewer, and editor is part of a collective sensemaking process used to test that new information is worth knowing and acting upon. 

*同行评议是将信息转化为知识过程的一部分。作者、审稿人和编辑之间的通信是集体意义构建过程的一部分，用于测试新信息是否值得了解和采取行动。*

The system of peer review is not perfect, but it does make a number of ==critical contributions== to the standard of scientific research publications.Specifically, peer review

*同行评议制度并不完善，但它确实为科学研究出版物的标准做出了一些重要贡献。*

- ==confirms that the hypotheses== have been tested appropriately and that results reported reflect the materials, methods, and analysis tools used;*确认假设已得到适当的检验，报告的结果反映了所使用的材料、方法和分析工具;*
- ==confirms that the strength of claims== about the results and the implications of the study are appropriate;*确认关于结果的声明的强度和研究的含义是适当的;*
- ==assists journals== to decide whether the ==focus, novelty, and importance== of the research are appropriate for the standard of the journal;*协助期刊决定研究的焦点、新颖性和重要性是否适合期刊的标准;*
- checks that ==the presentation and style of the content== conforms to accepted ==conventions== for production and reader convenience; and*检查内容的呈现和风格是否符合生产和读者方便的公认惯例;而且*
- advises the authors and the journal editor about how (and often where) ==the manuscript could be improved.==*建议作者和期刊编辑如何(通常是哪里)改进稿件。*

## 13.3 Understanding the editor’s role|了解编辑的作用
The editor is responsible for maintaining the reputation of the journal by publishing papers of scientific merit within the scope of the journal. Editors use reviewers to assist them in selecting manuscripts and improving them for publication. The editor (or a designated member of the editorial team) will read the manuscript and make the initial decision as to whether it will be sent to reviewers. 

编辑负责通过在期刊范围内发表具有科学价值的论文来维护期刊的声誉。编辑使用审稿人来帮助他们选择稿件并改进其出版。编辑（或编辑团队的指定成员）将阅读手稿，并做出是否将其发送给审稿人的初步决定。

The editor will usually reject a manuscript ==without review== only if the manuscript is outside the scope or aims of the journal, if the language or structure of the manuscript is poor, or if there are clear or obvious flaws in the science (see Table 14.1 for a guide to dealing with rejection). 

只有当稿件超出了期刊的范围或目标，如果稿件的语言或结构不好，或者在科学上存在明显或明显的缺陷时，编辑才会在不经审查的情况下拒绝稿件（参见表14.1中处理拒绝的指南）。

A well-prepared manuscript reporting science appropriate to the journal and its standard is unlikely to be rejected without review; however, some journal editors may apply a high standard when determining if the manuscript should be reviewed. 

一份精心准备的报告科学的手稿适合该杂志及其标准，不可能在未经审查的情况下被拒绝；然而，一些期刊编辑在决定是否应该对稿件进行审查时可能会采用高标准。

You can use the contributor’s covering letter to assist the editor in deciding that your manuscript is appropriate for review.

您可以使用投稿人的附信来帮助编辑决定您的稿件是否适合审阅。

## 13.4 The contributor’s covering letter 投稿人的附信

The covering letter you send to the editor with your manuscript (this generally means uploading your message in the appropriate box on the journal’s submission website) is an important opportunity to sell your paper. The covering letter is an opportunity to demonstrate that you appreciate the role of the editor and that you have done everything you can to prepare the manuscript to meet the journal’s requirements. You can use the covering letter to

你向编辑发送的附信和你的手稿（这通常意味着将你的信息上传到期刊投稿网站的相应框中）是一个出售论文的重要机会。附信是一个机会，可以证明你欣赏编辑的角色，并且你已经尽一切努力准备手稿以满足期刊的要求。你可以用求职信

- express your belief that the paper is within the scope of the journal and will contribute to meeting its aims;*表达你的信念，你的论文是在期刊的范围内，并将有助于实现其目标;*
- state the title of the manuscript and the names of the authors;*注明稿件名称和作者姓名;*
- state that the research is new and original and has not been published or submitted elsewhere;*声明该研究是新的和原创的，没有在其他地方发表或提交;*
- ==highlight specific points== that reinforce the novelty and significance of the research (avoid simply repeating sentences from the abstract, which the editor already has to hand);*突出强调研究的新颖性和重要性的具体要点(避免简单地重复摘要中的句子，因为编辑已经有了);*
- highlight any points about the manuscript which may raise questions for the editor, e.g. that a long paper is justified or that photographs are necessary to report important findings;*强调稿件中可能给编辑带来问题的地方，例如，一篇很长的论文是合理的，或者有必要用照片报道重要的发现;*
- express hope that the presentation is satisfactory; and*表示希望演示是令人满意的;而且*
- say that you look forward to the reviewers’ comments (Task 13.1).*说你期待评审员的评论（任务13.1）。*

## 13.5 Understanding the reviewer’s role|了解审查员的作用

Editors enlist the help of two or more independent researchers to peer review each manuscript and check the quality, novelty, and significance of the work and the presentation of the manuscript. This work is usually unpaid and is undertaken as part of the professional contribution of researchers to the development of their field of science. Reviewers will

编辑招募两个或两个以上独立研究人员的帮助，对每一篇稿件进行同行审查，检查工作的质量、新颖性和意义以及稿件的呈现方式。这项工作通常是无偿的，作为研究人员对其科学领域发展的专业贡献的一部分。评论家将

- usually be ==expert in the general== field of the paper (not necessarily expert in the exact subject of the paper to be reviewed); 通常是论文的一般领域的专家(不一定是论文的具体主题的专家)
- almost always have published work in the ==general field== themselves (possibly work that has been cited in your paper); 几乎总是发表了自己在一般领域的工作(可能已经在您的论文中引用的工作)
- be busy with their own research, writing, teaching, administration, family, etc.;要忙于自己的研究、写作、教学、行政、家庭等
- be willing to review manuscripts but have limited time and patience; and 愿意审稿，但时间和耐心有限;和
- have their own preferences and biases about scientific research and writing.对科学研究和写作有自己的偏好和偏见。
表格

The journal may have asked you to nominate potential reviewers at the time of submission, or the editor may have chosen them from a database or using professional networks. You will not know who the reviewers are. In many but not all cases, depending on the policy of the journal, the reviewers will know the names of the authors. The reviewers will be asked to read the manuscript, write a report about the quality of the work, note any problems, and recommend any changes that would improve the manuscript. The reviewers will usually be asked to complete an evaluation form about the quality of the manuscript as well, and may also be asked to recommend whether or not the manuscript should be accepted by the journal or accepted after revisions. The reviewers will return their written report and the evaluation form to the editor, sometimes with annotations on the manuscript (although this is now less common with electronic submission and review).

期刊可能在投稿时要求你提名潜在的审稿人，或者编辑可能从数据库或使用中选择他们专业网络。你不会知道评论者是谁。在许多情况下，但并非所有情况下，根据期刊的政策，审稿人都会知道作者的姓名。审稿人将被要求阅读手稿，撰写一份关于作品质量的报告，注意任何问题，并建议任何可以改进手稿的修改。审稿人通常会被要求填写一份关于手稿质量的评估表，也可能会被要求建议手稿是否应该被期刊接受或在修订后被接受。审稿人会将他们的书面报告和评估表返还给编辑，有时还会在手稿上加上注释（尽管现在电子提交和审核不太常见）。

Journals have their own sets of instructions for reviewers. These are sometimes available on the journal’s website, or a colleague who has reviewed for the journal may be able to show them to you. We have constructed an example reviewer’s evaluation form that includes the main questions to which reviewers are commonly asked to respond (see Figure 13.2). An example of a written report from a reviewer is shown in Figure 13.3. Task 13.2 provides practice with these elements.

期刊有自己的审稿指南。这些信息有时可以在杂志的网站上找到，或者为杂志进行过评论的同事可以向您展示。我们构建了一个示例评审员评估表，其中包括评审员通常需要回答的主要问题（见图13.2）。评审员的书面报告示例如图13.3所示。任务13.2提供了这些要素的实践。

Task 13.2 Journal club 期刊俱乐部

Form or join a journal club with between 3 and 10 colleagues in related fields of research and arrange to meet regularly (e.g. once a month). Choose some recent articles of interest to the group and arrange to discuss one of the articles at each meeting. Each member of the group should use the reviewer evaluation report questions in Figure 13.2 to develop a reviewer’s report on the article. At the journal club meeting, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the paper and any improvements that could have been made. (See Chapter 16 for additional ideas on journal clubs.)

与3至10名相关研究领域的同事组成或加入期刊俱乐部，并安排定期会面（例如每月一次）。选择小组最近感兴趣的文章，并安排在每次会议上讨论其中一篇文章。小组的每个成员都应使用图13.2中的评审员评估报告问题来编写一份关于文章的评审员报告。在期刊俱乐部会议上，讨论论文的优点和缺点，以及可能做出的任何改进。（有关期刊俱乐部的其他想法，请参见第16章。）

## 13.6 Understanding the editor’s role (continued)了解编辑的角色(续)

The editor receives the reports from the reviewers and decides what response will be made to the author(s). If the reviewers disagree (especially if there are only two reviewers), the editor will sometimes send the manuscript to a third reviewer for an additional opinion. The editor then writes to the corresponding author with the decision that has been made. Responding to these letters from journal editors is a skill in itself and is the subject of Chapter 14.

编辑从审稿人那里收到报告，并决定如何回应作者。如果审稿人不同意(尤其是只有两名审稿人)，编辑有时会将稿件发送给第三位审稿人，以获得额外的意见。然后编辑将所做的决定写信给通讯作者。回复这些期刊编辑的来信本身就是一种技巧，也是第十四章的主题。
