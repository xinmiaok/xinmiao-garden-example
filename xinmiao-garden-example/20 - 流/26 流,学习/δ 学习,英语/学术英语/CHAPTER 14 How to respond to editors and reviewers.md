## 14.1 Rules of thumb|经验法则

Critical comments about our research or writing can be difficult to accept and respond to. We recommend the following Rules of thumb as a framework for responding to reviewer and editor reports on your manuscript.

对我们的研究或写作的批评可能很难接受和回应。我们推荐以下经验法则作为一个框架来回应审稿人和编辑对你的手稿的报告。

Rule 1 It is rare that the reviewer/editor is completely right and the author completely wrong, or that the author is completely right and the reviewer completely wrong.

规则1很少出现审稿人/编辑完全正确而作者完全错误，或者作者完全正确而审稿人完全错误的情况。

Rule 2 When responding to a reviewer, the object is to accommodate the reviewer by addressing their comments without compromising the message (story) of the paper.

规则2当回复审稿人时，目标是在不损害论文信息(故事)的前提下，通过处理他们的评论来适应审稿人。

Rule 3 Always show the editor that you are doing everything you can to improve the manuscript.

规则3:总是向编辑展示你正在尽一切努力改进稿件。

Rule 4 Rejection and criticism do not automatically mean that the science is not good or that the paper is not well written: consider other journals, including additional work, or rewriting some or all of the paper.

第4条拒绝和批评并不一定意味着科学不好或论文写得不好:考虑其他期刊，包括额外的工作，或重写部分或全部论文。

## 14.2 How to deal with manuscript rejection|如何处理退稿

If your manuscript is rejected, it is important to determine the reasons why. 如果你的手稿被拒绝，确定原因很重要。

The reasons for rejection will inform your decision about how to proceed.拒绝的原因将告知您如何继续的决定。 

Every ==experienced researcher== has a story of ==rejection==, and it can be useful to discuss rejection with a ==senior colleague== to help you see that it is a ==natural and necessary== part of the process of legitimizing scientific knowledge. 每一位有经验的研究人员都有一个被拒绝的故事，与一位资深同事讨论被拒绝的问题，有助于你了解这是科学知识合法化过程中自然而必要的一部分。

Almost every one of these colleagues will also tell you that all or some of the data from their rejected manuscripts were eventually published. 几乎所有这些同事都会告诉你，他们被拒绝的手稿中的全部或部分数据最终都被发表了。

Remember, ==everyone gets rejections==. Successful authors are successful at ==dealing with rejection== as well as ==acceptance==. 记住，每个人都会被拒绝。成功的作者在处理拒绝和接受方面都很成功。

Reasons why your manuscript may have been rejected and recommendations on how to proceed are listed in Table 14.1.

表14.1列出了您的手稿可能被拒绝的原因以及如何继续的建议。

## 14.3 How to deal with “conditional acceptance” or “revise and resubmit”|如何处理“有条件接受”或“修改并重新提交”

Few manuscripts are accepted for publication without some revision. The level of revision ==varies from minor changes to the language, references, or formatting to major revisions== which may require resubmission for fresh reviewing. 

*很少有未经修改的稿件被接受出版。修订的程度==各不相同，从对语言、参考资料或格式的微小更改到==可能需要重新提交以进行重新审查的==重大修改==。*

In fields where ==journals compete== for a share of the ==new and interesting research in a discipline== and/or a ==share of the subscription market==, journal editors aim to accept ==high-quality== manuscripts as quickly as possible and get them into print (or available ==online== on the journal website) in a ==timely== manner. 

*在那些期刊争相在某一学科的新奇有趣的研究和/或订阅市场中占有一席之地的领域，期刊编辑的目标是尽快接受高质量的稿件，并及时将其付印(或在期刊网站上在线获得)*。

When the science is obviously ==interesting and new== but the manuscript requires ==major work== before it is acceptable, the editor may reject the paper but encourage rewriting and resubmission. 

当科学研究明显有趣和新颖，但手稿在被接受之前需要进行重大修改时，编辑可能会拒绝这篇论文，但鼓励重写和重新提交。

If the manuscript requires some modification but not major restructuring, additional research, or rewriting, the editor may accept the manuscript on the condition that recommended changes are made and the article returned by a set date. 

如果稿件需要一些修改，但不是重大的重组、额外的研究或重写，编辑可以接受稿件的条件是，按照建议的修改，并在规定的日期前归还文章。

An example of a conditional acceptance letter is provided in Figure 14.1. This conditional acceptance gives you the opportunity to consider and incorporate the comments of reviewers and the editor. However, it is not always easy to understand or address reviewer comments.

图14.1给出了一个有条件录取函的例子。这种有条件的接受使您有机会考虑和合并审阅人员和编辑的意见。然而，理解或处理审稿人的评论并不总是那么容易。

![[Pasted image 20221124102308.png]]

---

N.B. The difference between a conditional acceptance and a revise and resubmit response may only be visible in the wording the editor uses in their letter to you. Your first task when you receive the response is to decide what the editor means, and this is not always easy. The editor may use indirect language in the interest of being polite and maintaining your good opinion of the journal for future occasions. If you are in any doubt about the meaning, show the letter to a colleague and discuss it. In any case, you will need to communicate with your co-authors about your response while deciding your strategy for the next stage in the process.

有条件接受与修改并重新提交回复之间的区别可能仅在编辑在给您的信中使用的措辞中可见。当你收到回复时，你的第一个任务是决定编辑的意思，这并不总是容易的。编辑可能会使用间接的语言，以保持礼貌，并在未来的场合保持你对杂志的好感。如果你对这封信的含义有任何疑问，请把信拿给同事看，然后讨论。在任何情况下，在决定下一阶段的策略时，您都需要与合作作者沟通您的反应。

There are many ways to deal with reviewers’ comments and you will develop your own strategies. Here, we outline an approach used by many experienced authors.

有很多方法可以处理评论者的评论，你可以制定自己的策略。在这里，我们概述了许多有经验的作者使用的方法。

- Do not get angry or offended by the comments. The reviewer or editor may have ==misunderstood== something or you may ==have communicated it poorly==. Dealing with ==reviewers’ comments== is part of the publishing process and they should not be seen as ==a personal attack== on your ==credibility== as a scientist.*不要因为这些评论而生气或被冒犯。审稿人或编辑可能误解了某些东西，或者你可能沟通得不好。处理审稿人的评论是发表过程的一部分，它们不应该被视为对你作为科学家的信誉的个人攻击。*
- Read the comments and check the manuscript to make sure you understand what the referee or editor is asking you to do.*阅读评论并检查稿件，确保你理解了主审或编辑要求你做的事情。*
- Highlight any comments which are difficult to respond to or are unclear.*突出任何难以回应或不清楚的评论。*
- Show the difficult comments to ==co-authors== or ==colleagues== and seek their advice about how to deal with them. If comments are still difficult or unclear, or they annoy you, leave them for a few days (not more than a week) and ==return to address== them when you have had time to absorb them.*向合著者或同事展示困难的评论，并寻求他们的建议如何处理它们。如果评论仍然很难理解或不清楚，或者它们让你感到厌烦，那就把它们放一段时间(不要超过一个星期)，等你有时间消化后再回来处理它们。*
- Review the Rules of thumb (Section 14.1).回顾经验法则(第14.1节)。
- Make all the small changes which do not require major rewriting and note each change in a letter to the editor.*做所有不需要重写的小改动，并在给编辑的信中记下每一个改动。*
- Respond to any major comments using the suggested responses in Table 14.2.*使用表 14.2中的建议回复任何主要评论*。

### Main types of reviewer comments|审稿人评论的主要类型

Every review is different and will present different challenges to which to respond. However, the majority of reviewer comments fall into the seven categories listed here:每次审查都是不同的，也会带来不同的挑战。然而，大多数审稿人的评论可以分为以下7类:

1 The aims of the study are not clear.*这项研究的目的尚不明确。*

2 The theoretical premise or “school of thought” on which the work is based is challenged.*该著作所依据的理论前提或“学派”受到了挑战。*

3 The experimental design or analysis methods are challenged.*实验设计或分析方法受到了挑战。*

4 You are asked to supply additional data or information that would improve the paper.*要求您提供其他数据或信息，以改进论文。*

5 You are asked to remove information or discussion.*要求您删除信息或讨论。*

6 The conclusions are considered incorrect, weak, or too strong.*这些结论被认为是不正确的、薄弱的或过于强烈的。*

7 The referee has unspecific negative comments, e.g. “poorly designed,” “poorly written,” “badly organized,” “tables are too large,” “relevant literature not cited,” or “English is poor.”*裁判给出的负面评价不明确，例如“设计糟糕”、“写作糟糕”、“组织糟糕”、“表格太大”、“没有引用相关文献”或“英语很差”。*

---

Decide which of these categories each of the difficult comments falls into. If these categories do not cover the comment you have received, decide what the comment is really about and consider whether the approaches recommended in Table 14.2 are still appropriate. If you have a conditional acceptance from the editor, then none of the comments is enough to stop you publishing the paper. In any situation where you need to revise your manuscript in the light of referee comments, the main exercise is to maintain the integrity of your story while accommodating the referees and editor.

决定每个困难的评论属于哪一类。如果这些类别不包括您收到的评论，请确定评论的真正内容，并考虑表14.2中建议的方法是否仍然适用。如果你得到了编辑的有条件接受，那么这些评论都不足以阻止你发表论文。在任何情况下，如果你需要根据裁判的意见修改你的稿件，主要的工作是在满足裁判和编辑的要求的同时保持故事的完整性。

---

Table 14.2 sets out each of the main types of comments you are likely to receive from the referees and editor and recommends a series of approaches to responding to the comments. The recommended responses to each comment type range from easy to more difficult, and some comment types may require a mixture of responses.Many reviewers’ comments can be addressed by appropriate use of the two most powerful tools available to writers of scientific articles, as follows:

表14.2列出了您可能从裁判和编辑处收到的每种主要评论类型，并推荐了一系列回应评论的方法。对每种评论类型的建议回答从简单到困难不等，有些评论类型可能需要混合回答。许多审稿人的评论可以通过适当使用科学文章作者可用的两种最强大的工具来解决，如下所示：

- **Citing the published literature.** Published works have already been reviewed and accepted by the scientific community. The findings and conclusions that have been published by different authors can be compared and contrasted and used to develop an idea or support an argument.*引用已出版的文献。发表的作品已经被科学界审查和接受。不同作者发表的研究结果和结论可以进行比较和对比，并用来发展一个观点或支持一个论点。*
- **Improving the structure of the manuscript.** The structure and logic of each section and subsection of a scientific article are described in this book. Reviewing the relevant chapters of the book will help you to deal with reviewers’ comments by helping you improve the structure of your ideas or arguments.*改进稿件结构。一篇科学文章的每一节的结构和逻辑在这本书中被描述。复习书中的相关章节将帮助你通过改进你的观点或论点的结构来处理审稿人的评论。*

---

Use Table 14.2 to decide on the appropriate response(s) to comments and the place(s) in the manuscript where changes should be made (the reviewers’ comments may also indicate where changes can be made). Table 14.2 also indicates which sections of this book to review as part of dealing with reviewers’ comments Complete Task 14.1 to consolidate your understanding.

使用表14.2来决定对评论的适当回应以及手稿中应进行更改的位置（审阅者的评论也可能表明可以进行更改的地方）。表14.2还指出了本书的哪些章节需要阅读，作为处理审阅者评论的一部分。完成任务14.1以巩固您的理解。

Task 14.1 Analysing an authentic example|任务14.1分析真实案例

Ask a colleague who has had an article reviewed to show you the reviewers’ comments and their response.请一位曾审阅过文章的同事向您展示审阅者的评论和他们的回应。

1 Decide which of the seven types of reviewer comments listed in Table 14.2 were made.1确定表14.2中列出的七种评审意见中的哪一种。

2 Check whether the responses the author made fit the suggested response types in Table 14.2.2检查作者的回答是否符合表14.2中建议的回答类型。

3 Discuss the thinking behind the responses with the author.3与作者讨论回答背后的想法。

See Chapter 16 for additional suggestions about using previous reviews as a training tool.请参阅第16章，了解有关将以前的评审用作培训工具的其他建议。

### Return or resubmit your manuscript with a letter to the editor|退回或重新提交你的手稿，并给编辑写一封信

It is important to respond quickly to reviewers’ comments and the editor’s recommendation about publishing the manuscript. This is true regardless of whether the manuscript has been accepted with minor changes or you have been encouraged to resubmit it after major revision. As with the covering letter you sent when you originally submitted the manuscript, the letter accompanying the revised manuscript is an opportunity to demonstrate that you appreciate the role of the editor and that you have done everything you can to improve the manuscript to meet the journal’s and the reviewers’ requirements. Use the letter responding to reviewers’ comments to do these things:

迅速回应审稿人的评论和编辑关于发表稿件的建议是很重要的。这是正确的，无论手稿是否经过了小的修改，或者您被鼓励在大的修改后重新提交。与您最初提交手稿时发送的附信一样，修改后的手稿附带的信是一个机会，表明您欣赏编辑的角色，并已尽一切努力改进手稿，以满足期刊和审稿人的要求。使用回复审阅者评论的信函来完成以下操作：

- list the main changes you have made ==individually==, referring to referees’ reports; *参考推荐人的报告，分别列出你所做的主要改变;*
- say you have also corrected ==minor errors== (e.g. English);*说明你已经纠正了一些小错误(如英语);*
- point out ==supportive comments== by referees and any ==disagreements== between them (==side with== the reviewer you think is right and try to get the editor on your side);*指出推荐人的支持性评论和他们之间的任何分歧(站在你认为正确的审稿人一边，并努力让编辑站在你这边);*
- defend your work if a referee is factually wrong (another chance to cite key published papers supporting your argument); and *如果一个推荐人实际上是错误的，为你的工作辩护(另一个引用支持你论点的关键发表论文的机会);*
- say you believe the paper is important research and is now acceptable.说*你相信这篇论文是重要的研究，现在可以接受了。*

A useful structure is to copy all of the reviewers’ comments into your letter (use a typeface that distinguishes them from your responses, e.g. bold) and write a response to each one, also quoting your revised text and/or giving the line numbers where it can be found in the revised version. Recheck that the changes to the manuscript conform to the guidelines in the Instructions to Contributors (e.g. formatting, length, style). Figure 14.2 shows an example of a letter responding to reviewers’ comments.

一个有用的结构是将所有审稿人的评论复制到你的信中(使用一种与你的回复不同的字体，例如粗体)，并对每一个评论写一个回复，同时引用你修改过的文本和/或给出在修改版本中可以找到的行号。重新检查稿件的修改是否符合投稿说明中的指导方针(例如格式、长度、风格)。图14.2显示了一个回复审稿人评论的信件示例。

Send the revised manuscript back to the editor, together with your letter responding to the reviews.

把修改过的手稿连同你对评论的回复一起寄回给编辑。
