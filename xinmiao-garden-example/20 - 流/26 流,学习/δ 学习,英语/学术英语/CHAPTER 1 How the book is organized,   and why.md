这本书是如何组织的，以及为什么

## 1.1 Getting started with writing for international publication|开始为国际出版物写作

Welcome to the process of writing your research results as a paper for submission to an international refereed journal!
- You may speak and write English as your first language, or as an additional language: 
	- we have written this book for all authors 
		- wanting improved strategies for writing effective scientific papers in an efficient way,
		-  including those new to the task.

*欢迎将您的研究结果作为论文提交给国际参考期刊！你可以把英语作为你的第一语言，或者作为一种额外的语言来说和写：我们为所有想要以有效的方式撰写有效科学论文的改进策略的作者写了这本书，包括那些对这项任务不熟悉的作者。*

### terms术语
#### paper and genre
In this book, we will use other terms as well as ==[[[[paper]]]]== for what you are aiming to write: 
- it may be called ==a [[manuscript]], a [[journal article]], or a [[research article]]==.
	-  (See Chapter 2 for comments on other types of scientific articles,
	-  Chapter 12 for writing review articles, 
	- and Chapter 18 for how to apply the book’s approach to writing funding grant proposals.) 
- All of these terms are in use in books and websites providing information and advice about this type of document: this ==genre==. 
	- The concept of genre is important for the way this book works, 
		- as we have based our approach in writing it on the findings of researchers who work in the field of genre analysis.
		- These researchers study documents of a particular type 
			- to identify the features 
				- that make them recognizable as what they are.

在这本书中，我们将使用其他术语以及==论文==来描述你的写作目标：它可能被称为==手稿、期刊文章或研究文章==。（其他类型的科学文章的评论见第2章，评论文章的写作见第12章，如何应用本书见第18章）编写基金申请建议的方法。）
所有这些术语都在书籍和网站中使用，提供关于这类文档的信息和建议：这一体裁。体裁的概念对于本书的工作方式很重要，
因为我们的写作方法是基于体裁分析领域研究人员的发现。这些研究人员研究特定类型的文档，以确定使其可识别的特征。

### the idea of the audience for a document
- One of the key concepts in use in this field of research is the idea of the audience for a document 
	- as a key factor in helping an author write effectively. 
- Whenever you write any document, it is helpful to think first about your audience: 
	- whom do you see in your mind’s eye as the reader of what you are writing? 
	- The idea of audience belongs as part of a “==communication matrix==” made up of four elements: 
		- ==audience== (as described in the previous sentence), 
		- ==purpose== (what do you want the document to achieve?), 
		- ==format== (how will the required format constrain how you write the document?), and 
		- ==assessment== (what criteria will be used to decide if the document is successful?). 
	- We will use all the elements of this [[matrix]] to guide our discussion of the genres 
		- we will analyse in the book, and we begin now by thinking about the audience for a scientific research article.

*在这一研究领域中使用的一个关键概念是读者对文档的看法，这是帮助作者有效写作的关键因素。每当你写任何文件时，首先考虑一下你的读者是很有帮助的：你认为谁是你所写内容的读者？受众的概念属于“传播矩阵”的一部分，由四个要素组成：受众（如前一句所述）、目的（您希望文档实现什么？）、格式（所需的格式将如何约束您编写文档的方式？），和评估（将使用什么标准来决定文件是否成功？）。我们将使用这个矩阵的所有元素来指导我们对书中分析的类型的讨论，现在我们开始思考一篇科学研究文章的受众。*

### Who is your audience?

- Often the audience that you think of 
	- first is your ==scientific peers== – people working in areas related to yours who will want to know about your results – and this is certainly a primary audience for a research article. 
	- However, there is another “audience” 
		- whose requirements must be met before your peers will even get a chance to see your article in print: 
		- ==the journal editor and reviewers== (also called referees; see Chapters 3, 13, and 14 for more information). 
			- These people are often thought of as gate-keepers (or as a filter), 
				- because their role is to ensure that 
					- only articles that meet the journal’s standards and requirements are allowed to enter or pass through. 
			- Therefore, it can be useful from the beginning to find out and [[bear in mind]] 
				- as much information as you can 
				- about what these requirements are. 
			- In this book, we refer to these requirements as ==reviewer criteria== (see Chapters 3 and 14 for details), 
				- and we use them as a framework to help unpack the expectations that both audiences have of a research article written in English. 
				- We aim to unpack these expectations in two different but closely interrelated ways: in terms of

- the ==content== of each article section and its presentation; 
- and ==the English language features== commonly used to present that content.

*通常，你首先想到的受众是你的科学同行——在与你相关的领域工作的人，他们想知道你的结果——这当然是一篇研究文章的主要受众。然而，在你的同行甚至有机会看到你的文章之前，还有另一个“受众”的要求必须得到满足：期刊编辑和审稿人（也称为审稿人；更多信息请参见第3、13和14章）。这些人通常被认为是把关人（或过滤器），因为他们的职责是确保只有符合期刊标准和要求的文章才能进入或通过。因此，从一开始就找出并记住尽可能多的关于这些需求的信息是有用的。在本书中，我们将这些要求称为评审标准（详见第3章和第14章），并将其作为一个框架，帮助解开两位读者对用英语撰写的研究文章的期望。我们的目标是以两种不同但密切相关的方式来解读这些期望：*

*- 每个文章部分的内容及其介绍；*
*- 是通常用于呈现该内容的英语特征。*

- To do this, the book uses an [[interdisciplinary]] approach, 
	- combining insights from experienced science authors and reviewers about content, 
	- with those from specialist teachers of research communication in English about the language. 
- Elements of language that are broadly relevant to most readers of the book will be discussed in each chapter. 
- In addition, Chapter 17 focuses on ways 
	- in which users of English as an additional language (EAL) can develop the discipline-specific English 
		- needed to write effectively for international publication.
	-  This chapter can be studied at any stage in the process of working through the book, after you have completed Chapter 1.

*为了做到这一点，本书采用了跨学科的方法，将经验丰富的科学作者和评论家关于内容的见解与英语研究交流专业教师关于语言的见解相结合。每一章都将讨论与本书大多数读者广泛相关的语言元素。此外，第17章重点介绍了英语作为一种附加语言（EAL）的用户如何开发为国际出版有效写作所需的特定学科英语。完成第一章后，可以在读完本书的过程中的任何阶段学习本章。*

## 1.2 Publishing in the international literature|国际文献出版

If you are going to become involved in publishing in the international literature, there are a number of questions it is useful to consider at the outset: 
- Why publish? 
- Why is it difficult to publish? 
- What does participation in the international scientific community require? 
- What do you need to know to select your target journal? 
- How can you get the most out of publishing? 
- We consider these questions in turn below.

如果你打算参与国际文学的出版，在一开始就要考虑一些问题：为什么要出版？为什么很难出版？参与国际科学界需要什么？你需要知道什么才能选择你的目标期刊？如何从出版中获得最大收益？我们在下面依次考虑这些问题。

### Why publish? 
We have already suggested that researchers publish to share ideas and results with colleagues. These are some other reasons for publishing:

*为什么要出版？我们已经建议研究人员发表论文，与同事分享想法和结果。以下是发布的其他一些原因：*

- to leave a record of research which can be added to by others;|留下可供他人补充的研究记录；
- to receive due recognition for ideas and results; and |对想法和成果给予应有的认可；和
- to attract interest from others in the area of research.|以吸引研究领域其他人的兴趣。

However, there are two additional reasons that are very important for internationally oriented scientists:

*然而，还有两个额外的原因对面向国际的科学家来说非常重要：*

- to receive expert feedback on results and ideas; and 接受关于结果和想法的专家反馈；和
- to legitimize the research; i.e. receive independent verification of methods and results.使研究合法化；i. e.接受方法和结果的独立验证。

These reasons underscore the importance of the review process we discussed above. However, there are difficulties associated with getting work published: difficulties that operate for all scientists, plus some that are specific to scientists working in contexts where English is a foreign or second language, which together are known as EAL contexts.

这些原因强调了我们上面讨论的审查过程的重要性。然而，发表工作也存在一些困难：所有科学家都面临的困难，还有一些是在英语是外语或第二语言的环境中工作的科学家特有的困难，这些文本统称为EAL文本。

### Why is it difficult to publish?
#### writing is a skill
- In addition to the ==language-related barriers that spring to mind==, 
- it is also important to ==realize that writing is a skill==, whatever the language. 
- Many of the points covered in this book are equally important for EAL scientists and those who speak English as their first language.

*除了脑海中浮现的与语言相关的障碍之外，重要的是要意识到写作是一种技能，无论是哪种语言。本书所涵盖的许多要点对EAL科学家和以英语为第一语言的人同样重要。*

#### Getting published is also a skill
==Getting published is also a skill==: not all writers are published. Some reasons for this fact include the following:
[[potential criticism]]
*出版也是一项技能：并非所有作家都能出版。这一事实的一些原因包括：*

- Not all research is ==new== or of ==sufficient scientific interest==.
- Experiments do ==not always work==: positive results are easier to publish.
- Scientific journals have ==specific requirements== which can be difficult to ==meet==: publishing is a buyer’s market

- 并非所有的研究都是新的或具有足够的科学兴趣。
- 实验并不总是有效的：积极的结果更容易发表。
- 科学期刊有可能难以满足的特定要求：出版是买方市场

These issues will be addressed as you proceed through the book.这些问题将在您继续阅读本书时解决。
#### potential criticism
- Another reason that researchers find the writing and publication process difficult is that communicating your work and ideas opens you up to ==potential criticism==.
	- The process of advancing concepts, ideas, and knowledge is [[adversarial]], 
	- and new results and ideas are often [[rigorously]] debated. 
- Authors facing the blank page and a potentially critical audience can find the task of writing very daunting. 
- This book offers frameworks for you 
	- to ==structure your thinking and writing== for each section of a scientific article 
	- and for dealing with the publishing process. 
	- The frameworks provided will allow you to ==break down the large task== of writing the whole manuscript ==into small tasks== of writing sections and subsections, and to navigate the publishing process.

*研究人员发现写作和出版过程困难的另一个原因是，交流你的作品和想法会让你面临潜在的批评。推进概念、想法和知识的过程是对抗性的，新的结果和想法经常会受到严格的辩论。面对空白页和潜在的批评性读者的作者会发现写作任务非常艰巨。这本书为你提供了框架，可以为科学文章的每一部分构建你的思维和写作，以及处理出版过程。所提供的框架将允许您将编写整个手稿的大任务分解为编写部分和子部分的小任务，并浏览出版过程。*

What does participation in the international scientific community require? 

参与国际科学界需要什么？

A helpful image is to think about submitting a manuscript to an international journal as a way of participating in the international scientific community. You are, in effect, joining an international conversation. To join this conversation, you need to know what has already been said by the other people conversing. In other words, you need to understand the “cutting edge” of your scientific discipline: what work is being done now by the important players in the field internationally.

一个很有帮助的形象是考虑将手稿提交给国际期刊，作为参与国际科学界的一种方式。实际上，你是在参加一场国际对话。要加入这个对话，你需要知道正在交谈的其他人已经说了什么。换句话说，你需要了解你的科学学科的“前沿”：国际上该领域的重要参与者正在做什么工作。

This means: 
- getting access to the journals where people in the field are publishing; 
- subscribing to the e-mail alert schemes offered by journal publishers on their websites so that you receive tables of contents when new issues are published; and 
- developing skills for searching the Internet and electronic databases in libraries to which you have access.

这意味着：
- 可以访问该领域人员正在出版的期刊；
- 订阅期刊出版商在其网站上提供的电子邮件警报方案，以便您在新期刊出版时收到目录；以及
- 开发在您可以访问的图书馆中搜索互联网和电子数据库的技能。

Without this, it will be difficult to write about your work so as to show how it fits into the progress being made in your field. In fact, this knowledge is important when the research is being planned, well before the time when the paper is being written: you should try to plan your research so it fits into a developing conversation in your field.

*如果没有这一点，就很难写下你的工作，从而表明你的工作如何适应你所在领域的进步。事实上，在计划研究时，早在论文撰写之前，这些知识就很重要：你应该努力计划研究，使其适合你所在领域的发展对话。*

when the research is being planned, well before the time when the paper is being written: you should try to plan your research so it fits into a developing conversation in your field.

*如果没有这一点，就很难写下你的工作，从而表明你的工作如何适应你所在领域的进步。事实上，在计划研究时，早在论文撰写之前，这些知识就很重要：你应该努力计划研究，使其适合你所在领域的发展对话。*

Active involvement in international conferences is an important way to gain access to this international world of research in your field. Therefore, you need both written and spoken English for communication with peers. This book aims to help with the written language, and some ideas for developing spoken science English are given in Chapter 16. As you become a member of the international research community in your field in these ways, you will develop the knowledge base you need to help you select the most appropriate journal for submission of your manuscript: we call this your target journal.

*积极参与国际会议是进入您所在领域的国际研究世界的重要途径。因此，你需要书面和口语来与同伴交流。本书旨在帮助学习书面语言，第16章给出了发展科学英语口语的一些想法。当你以这些方式成为你所在领域的国际研究团体的一员时，你将发展所需的知识库，以帮助你选择最合适的期刊提交你的稿件：我们称之为你的目标期刊。*

## 1.3 What do you need to know to select your target journal?|选择目标期刊需要知道什么？

Choosing the right journal for your manuscript will influence the chance of getting published easily and quickly. You should be thinking about the journal you want to publish in from the beginning of your research and should have made a choice by the time you begin to write the Introduction and Discussion sections of your paper.

*为你的稿件选择合适的期刊将影响你轻松、快速地出版的机会。从研究之初，你就应该考虑你想发表的期刊，在你开始撰写论文的导言和讨论部分时，你应该已经做出了选择。*

The right journal for you is the journal which optimizes the speed and ease of publication, the professional prestige you accrue, and the access for your desired audience. These factors are interwoven and it can be helpful to develop a publication plan to maximize your publication success. The journal of your choice may not choose to accept your article, and you are advised to have a list of preferred journals to turn to if you are rejected from your first choice. Here, we set out some issues to consider when choosing a journal for your manuscript.

*最适合你的期刊是能够优化出版速度和容易程度、你积累的专业声誉以及你想要的读者的访问权限的期刊。这些因素相互交织，制定出版计划有助于最大限度地提高出版成功率。您选择的期刊可能不会选择接受您的文章，如果您的第一选择被拒绝，建议您有一份首选期刊列表。在这里，我们列出了为您的手稿选择期刊时需要考虑的一些问题。*

- Does the journal normally publish the kind of work you have done? Check several issues and search the journal website, if it has one. It is helpful if you can cite work from the journal in the Introduction of your manuscript, to show that you are joining a conversation already in progress in the journal. Examine some of the key articles you refer to in your Introduction, and check which journals are cited in the Introductions of these articles. By following back through the literature, you should be able to develop a mind-map of the journals in the field of your research. The journals that are most often cited in the Introduction and Discussion sections of your manuscript will be most likely to accept work in your field.

*- 期刊通常会刊登你所做的工作吗？检查几个问题，如果有问题，请搜索期刊网站。如果你能在手稿的引言中引用期刊上的工作，以表明你正在加入期刊上已经在进行的对话，这是很有帮助的。检查你在引言中提到的一些关键文章，并检查这些文章的引言中引用了哪些期刊。通过回顾文献，你应该能够绘制出你研究领域期刊的思维导图。在你的手稿的引言和讨论部分中最常被引用的期刊最有可能接受你所在领域的工作。*

- Do the aims and scope of the journal match the content and the level of impact of your work for the field? Check the websites or issues of potential journals to identify those with scope and aims most appropriate for your manuscript. Here, you try to ensure that your article will reach the audience you want to read it, once it is published.

- *期刊的目标和范围是否与您在该领域工作的内容和影响程度相匹配？查看潜在期刊的网站或期刊，以确定最适合您手稿的范围和目标。在这里，你要努力确保你的文章一旦发表，就能够接触到你想要阅读的读者。*

- Is the journal of an appropriate standard for your needs? Firstly, does the journal referee the papers? This is absolutely imperative for enhancing the international credibility of your work. It may also be important to check the journal’s impact factor, if this measure is important for assessing research outcomes in your country or research context. (See Appendix for more information on impact factor, citation index, and other similar measurements.)

- *期刊是否符合您的需求？首先，期刊是否对论文进行裁判？这对于提高你的工作的国际信誉是绝对必要的。检查期刊的影响因素可能也很重要，如果这个衡量标准对评估你所在国家或研究背景下的研究成果很重要。（有关影响因子、引文指数和其他类似测量的更多信息，请参见附录。）*

- Does the journal publish reasonably quickly? Many journals include the dates when a manuscript was received and published underneath the title information, so you can check the likely timeline. Others include this information on their websites. Journals which publish an online version of the paper before the print version will usually have a faster time to publication. Journals want to publish submissions quickly to ensure they attract authors who are doing innovative and new work. You may also want to publish your research quickly to ensure that others do not publish similar work before you, and to increase your publication and citation record for promotions and grants.

- *这本杂志的出版速度合理吗？许多期刊的标题信息下都包含了稿件收到和发表的日期，因此您可以查看可能的时间线。其他人在他们的网站上包括这些信息。在印刷版之前出版在线版论文的期刊通常会有更快的出版时间。期刊希望快速发布投稿，以确保吸引那些正在进行创新和新工作的作者。你也可能希望迅速发表你的研究，以确保其他人不会在你之前发表类似的研究，并增加你的发表和引用记录，以获得晋升和资助。*

- Are there charges associated with publishing in this journal? Some journals charge authors a fee to publish, or to publish coloured illustrations. Check whether this is the case. If so, you can ask whether the journal is willing to waive these charges for authors in some parts of the world. You may also want your research to be accessible to a wide range of readers who do not have access to libraries or other subscriptions to journals in your field. Many journals now offer to provide Open Access to your paper (i.e. to make it accessible for free download without subscription to the journal) if you pay an upfront fee. Check whether the journal of your choice offers this service if you want (or are required by your institution) to pay for Open Access.

- *在这本杂志上发表文章是否有相关费用？一些期刊向作者收取出版费，或出版彩色插图。检查情况是否如此。如果是这样，你可以问该杂志是否愿意免除世界某些地区的作者的这些费用。你也可能希望你的研究能够被广泛的读者访问，这些读者无法访问图书馆或订阅你所在领域的期刊。现在，许多期刊都提供对你的论文的开放访问（即，如果你支付预付费，就可以免费下载，而无需订阅期刊）。如果您希望（或您的机构要求）为开放式访问付费，请检查您选择的期刊是否提供此服务。*

### How can you get the most out of publishing?|如何从出版中获得最大收益？

Publishing quickly is often helpful. In addition, publishing in a widely read journal is better for you (higher citation index; see Appendix). However, if you aim too high in relation to the international value of the work you have done, you may be rejected, and resubmission takes more time. These two issues have to be balanced carefully to determine an optimal strategy for your own situation. Finally, publishing where your peers will read the paper is important. Use Task 1.1 to summarize your understanding and complete Table 1.1. Discuss the outcomes with your co-authors to develop your publication strategy.

*快速出版通常很有帮助。此外，在广泛阅读的期刊上发表对你更有利（更高的引用指数；见附录）。然而，如果你的目标与你所做工作的国际价值相比太高，你可能会被拒绝，重新提交需要更多的时间。必须仔细平衡这两个问题，以确定适合自己情况的最佳策略。最后，在你的同行阅读论文的地方发表文章很重要。使用任务1.1总结您的理解并完成表1.1。与合作作者讨论结果，以制定您的出版策略。*

Once you have thought about the issues raised above, and made some preliminary decisions about a possible target journal, you are ready to move on to consider the aims of this book.

*一旦你思考了上面提出的问题，并对可能的目标期刊做出了一些初步决定，你就可以继续考虑本书的目标了。*

## 1.4 Aims of this book

The aims of the book are to provide you, the reader, with

*这本书的目的是为读者提供*

- an improved understanding of the structure and underlying logic of scientific research articles published in English in the international literature;*更好地理解国际文献中以英文发表的科学研究文章的结构和基本逻辑；*
- an overall strategy for turning a set of results into a paper for publication;*将一组结果转化为论文发表的总体策略；*
- skills for analysing the structure and language features of scientific articles in your own discipline, and for using the results of this analysis to improve your own scientific writing;*分析自己学科中科学文章的结构和语言特征的技能，并利用分析结果改进自己的科学写作；*
- knowledge of the stages involved in the process of submitting an article for publication, and strategies for completing each stage;*了解提交文章以供发表的过程中所涉及的阶段，以及完成每个阶段的策略；*
- knowledge and basic mastery of the specific English language features commonly used in each section of published articles;对*已发表文章的每一部分中常用的特定英语特征的知识和基本掌握；*
- strategies and tools for improving your own drafts, such as structured checklists, ways to strategically re-use relevant language elements, special-purpose software, and discipline-specific writing groups; and*改进自己草稿的策略和工具，如结构化检查表、策略性重用相关语言元素的方法、专用软件和特定学科写作小组；和*
- a process for completing a draft of an article on your own research results, prepared in the style of the journal to which you wish to submit.*完成一篇关于你自己研究成果的文章草稿的过程，按照你希望提交的期刊的风格编写。*

## 1.5 How the book is structured|书的结构

Two principles underlie the way we have organized this book: that people learn best by doing; and that you will want to continue developing your skills on your own or with colleagues in the future, even if you first encounter the book in a classroom environment. Therefore, we aim to show you how you can use examples of journal articles, from your own field and also from others, to learn more about writing for publication.

*我们组织这本书的方式有两个原则：人们通过实践学习最好；即使你是在课堂环境中第一次接触到这本书，你也希望在未来自己或与同事一起继续发展自己的技能。因此，我们的目标是向您展示如何使用来自您自己领域和其他领域的期刊文章示例，以了解更多关于出版写作的信息。*

title: Task 1.1 Analysing potential target journals
collapse: open
color: 88, 88, 124

To optimize the outcomes from publishing your manuscript, we recommend that you develop a publishing strategy. Part of the publication strategy is to select your preferred journal to submit the manuscript to. In order to make this choice, first select the three or four preferred journals in your field that you think would accept your manuscript. Then answer the following questions for each one and record the answers in Table 1.1.

为了优化出版手稿的结果，我们建议您制定出版策略。出版策略的一部分是选择你喜欢的期刊来投稿。为了做出这个选择，首先选择你认为可以接受你的稿件的三到四种你喜欢的领域期刊。然后针对每个问题回答以下问题，并将答案记录在表1.1中。

1 Has the journal published similar work with a similar level of novelty to yours in the last 3 years? Record a yes or no (if “no,” think carefully before submitting your manuscript to this journal).

1在过去3年里，该杂志是否发表了与你的作品具有相似新颖性的类似作品？记录“是”或“否”（如果“否”，请在向本杂志提交稿件之前仔细考虑）。

2 Does the journal’s scope and the content of recent articles match the main components of your manuscript, i.e. subject, methods, results? (Write down the main type of papers, e.g. plant physiology: non-molecular studies).

2期刊的范围和最近文章的内容是否与您的稿件的主要组成部分相匹配，即主题、方法和结果？（写下主要类型的论文，如植物生理学：非分子研究）。

3 What is the measure of relative journal quality/impact which is most important to you and your field of research? Record the score or measure for each journal (e.g. Journal Impact Factor or Journal Cited Half-Life).

3对你和你的研究领域最重要的期刊质量/影响的衡量标准是什么？记录每个期刊的得分或衡量标准（如期刊影响因子或期刊引用半衰期）。

4 What is the journal’s time to publication? (This may be on the journal’s website or recorded for each article in the journal.) Record the time or a score for fast or slow (e.g. less than 3 months from acceptance = fast; more than 1 year = slow).

4期刊的出版时间是什么？（这可以在期刊的网站上，也可以记录在期刊上的每一篇文章中。）记录时间或分数的快慢（例如，从接受开始不到3个月=快；超过1年=慢）。

5 Does the journal have page charges or provide Open Access if you want it (and can you pay if payment is required)? Examine the journal scores you have recorded in Table 1.1 and rank the journals in order of overall preference, taking all criteria into consideration.

5如果您需要，期刊是否收取页面费用或提供开放访问（如果需要付款，您可以支付）？检查您在表1.1中记录的日志分数，并按照总体偏好的顺序对日志进行排序，同时考虑所有标准。

```

To achieve this goal, the book will often invite you to discuss examples with a colleague and then report to a larger group. This assumes that you are using the book in a class situation. However, if you are using it for individual study, you can note down your answers and then revise them once you reach the end of a section. As we move through the book, you will also have the opportunity to draft (or substantially revise) your own article, section by section, if this is appropriate.

*为了实现这一目标，这本书通常会邀请你与同事讨论示例，然后向更大的团队汇报。这假设你在课堂上使用这本书。然而，如果你正在使用它进行个别学习，你可以记下你的答案，然后在一节结束时修改它们。在我们阅读这本书的过程中，如果合适的话，你也将有机会一节一节地起草（或实质性修改）你自己的文章。*

Instructions for activities in the book will use the following terms to refer to different categories of example articles:

*书中的活动说明将使用以下术语来指代不同类别的示例文章：*

- Provided Example Articles (PEAs): these are three articles chosen by the authors of the book and included in full at the back (Chapters 19, 20, and 21). You will use all three in the early sections of the book and then be asked to select one to use in more detail.*提供的示例文章（PEA）：这是本书作者选择的三篇文章，并在后面全文收录（第19、20和21章）。您将使用本书早期部分中的所有三个部分，然后要求您选择一个来更详细地使用。*
- Selected Article (SA): this is an article that you will choose from your own field of research and that may be from your target journal. You will choose your SA as you continue with Chapter 1 (Task 1.2)*.精选文章（SA）：这是一篇你将从自己的研究领域中选择的文章，可能来自你的目标期刊。您将在继续第1章（任务1.2）时选择SA。*
- Own Article (OA): this is the draft manuscript you will write using your own results as you progress through the book. If you do not yet have your own results, you can skip the tasks relating to the OA and come back to them later.自己的文章（OA）：*这是你在阅读这本书的过程中使用自己的结果撰写的手稿草稿。如果您还没有自己的结果，您可以跳过与OA相关的任务，稍后再返回。*

```ad-note
title: Task 1.2 Selecting an article to analys|选择要分析的文章
collapse: open
color: 88, 88, 124

Select an article in your own field of research to use as your SA (Selected Article), preferably from your target journal and preferably written by a native speaker of English (check authors’ names and the location of their work sites to help identify an author’s language background). We suggest that you do not choose your SA from Nature (UK) or Science (USA), as these two journals use conventions that are very different from most other journals. It will be more useful to learn the more usual conventions first, and then adapt them later if you need to.
(See Chapter 2 for more details on the differences in article structure.)

在你自己的研究领域选择一篇文章作为你的SA（精选文章），最好是从你的目标期刊上，最好是由英语母语者撰写（检查作者的姓名和工作地点，以帮助确定作者的语言背景）。我们建议您不要从《自然》（英国）或《科学》（美国）中选择SA，因为这两种期刊使用的惯例与大多数其他期刊截然不同。首先学习更常见的惯例，然后在需要时进行调整，这会更有用。

（有关文章结构差异的更多详细信息，请参见第2章。）

```

The following sections of the book work like this.

*本书的以下部分是这样工作的。*

We present information about the structure of research articles, section by section, which has been summarized from the work of scholars in the field of applied linguistics over the last 20 years. We present this as a description, not a prescription: i.e. “this is what the scholars have found,” not “this is what you should do.” We do this because there are many effective ways to write articles, not just one way. Our aim is to help you develop a repertoire (a range of effective possibilities) to select from, depending on the goals you have for a given article section.

*我们提供了关于研究文章结构的信息，这些信息是从过去20年来应用语言学领域学者的工作中总结出来的。我们将此作为描述而非处方：即“这是学者们发现的”，而不是“这是你应该做的”。我们这样做是因为有很多有效的方法来写文章，而不仅仅是一种方法。我们的目标是帮助您开发一个可供选择的剧目（一系列有效的可能性），具体取决于您对给定文章部分的目标。*

- Then we ask you to look at the relevant section of the PEAs and check whether you can find the described features there (answers to the Tasks can be found in the Answer pages at the end of the book).然后，我们要求您查看PEA的相关部分，并检查您是否可以在其中找到所描述的功能（任务的答案可以在本书末尾的答案页中找到）。
