培养专业英语技能

## 17.1 Introduction

It can be helpful to think of the English you need to write about your research as one English among many Englishes: the English of marine biology, for example, or the English of plant biotechnology. Therefore, to a certain extent, people new to a research field need to develop their discipline-specific English even if English is their first language. We have included the aspects of English usage that are of general interest for scientist authors in the previous chapters on writing each section of an article. This chapter, on the other hand, focuses on those aspects of English grammar and usage that are of particular relevance to science authors who use English as an additional language (EAL). We begin with a discussion of types of errors and how they are likely to affect the perceptions of editors and reviewers.We then introduce two strategies that can be useful for developing discipline-specific English writing skills: the concept of sentence templates and a computer-based tool called AdTAT (Adelaide Text Analysis Tool). We then focus on a selected range of features of scientific writing in English that we find present problems for many EAL science authors. We hope you will find something useful for addressing your own needs within these three different approaches.

把你需要写的关于你的研究的英语想象成多种英语中的一种是很有帮助的：例如，海洋生物学的英语，或者植物生物技术的英语。因此，在一定程度上，新进入研究领域的人需要发展他们的专业英语，即使英语是他们的第一语言。我们在前几章关于文章每一节的写作中，已经包含了科学家作者普遍感兴趣的英语用法。另一方面，本章侧重于英语语法和用法的那些方面，这些方面与将英语作为附加语言（EAL）的科学作者特别相关。我们首先讨论错误的类型，以及它们可能如何影响编辑和审稿人的看法。然后，我们介绍了两种有助于培养特定学科英语写作技能的策略：句子模板的概念和基于计算机的工具AdTAT（阿德莱德文本分析工具）。然后，我们将重点放在英语科学写作的一系列特点上，我们发现这些特点给许多EAL科学作者带来了问题。我们希望您能在这三种不同的方法中找到一些有用的东西来满足自己的需求。

## 17.2 Error types and editor expectations of language use

- ==Communicating meaning clearly== is the crucial factor in scientific writing. 
- It is worth thinking for a moment about ==what aspects of writing in English might interfere most seriously== with clear communication of meaning (Task 17.1).

明确传达意思是科学写作的关键因素。值得思考的是，英语写作的哪些方面可能会最严重地影响意义的清晰传达（任务17.1）。


Task 17.1 Types of errors
1 Discuss (or make individual notes): if you were an editor of an international journal published in English, what problems might you anticipate when editing articles submitted by scientists from EAL backgrounds? 2 Here we list some types of errors that are often made by EAL writers.

1讨论（或单独做笔记）：如果你是一份以英语出版的国际期刊的编辑，在编辑EAL背景的科学家提交的文章时，你可能会遇到什么问题？2这里我们列出了EAL编写者经常犯的一些类型的错误。

2 Complete Table 17.1 by writing the number of each error type in the appropriate column in terms of how often and/or how seriously you think that error affects the communication of meaning in science writing: rarely/ slightly; sometimes/moderately; or often/seriously.

2填写表17.1，根据您认为错误影响科学写作意义传达的频率和/或严重程度，在适当栏中填写每种错误类型的数量：很少/轻微；有时/适度；或者经常/严重地。

Table 17.1 Task 17.1, Part 2: Exercise in assigning types of English language errors to three possible levels of effect on meaning.表17.1任务17.1，第二部分:练习将英语语言错误的类型划分为影响意义的三个可能级别。

### What do journal editors say?期刊编辑怎么说?

- Journal editors have often discussed ==the problem of clarity of communication== in manuscripts. 
- journals do use a copy-editor; however, the general rule is that it is the ==author’s responsibility== to submit manuscripts in ==clearly understandable English==. 
- ==The quality of the science== is the ==primary concern== for journal editors; however, the science needs to be ==clearly understandable==: see the following quotations, from an Elsevier online editors’ forum in 2008 (www.elsevier.com/wps/find/editors.editors/editors_update/issue10d, accessed 16 January 2008).

*期刊编辑经常讨论稿件中交流的清晰度问题。有些期刊确实使用副本编辑器；然而，一般规则是，作者有责任以清晰易懂的英语提交手稿。科学的质量是期刊编辑最关心的问题；然而，科学需要清晰易懂*：参见爱思唯尔2008年在线编辑论坛上的以下引文（www.Elsevier.com/wps/find/editors.editors/editors_update/issue10d，2008年1月16日访问）。

> This is a long-standing problem. In the past it was solved to a large extent by detailed copy-editing of accepted papers. I became aware that this was apparently no longer being done when papers started appearing with ungrammatical titles.

这是一个长期存在的问题。在过去，这在很大程度上是通过对已录用论文进行详细的复制编辑来解决的。当论文开始出现不合语法的标题时，我意识到这显然已经不再是这样了。

> For the researcher and for the reviewer, we should emphasize the scientific contents of their work. Language skills should not be the barrier.

无论是对研究者还是对审稿人，都要强调其工作的科学性。语言技能不应该成为障碍。

> The Authors may have important data, which is useful for the Community, and must be helped.

作者可能拥有对社区有用的重要数据，必须得到帮助。

---

The ==key points== from this discussion are:这次讨论的要点是:
- good science is the most important thing; but这次讨论的要点是:
- the science needs to be clearly understandable.科学需要被清楚地理解。


-  Many journal websites now make it clear that the responsibility for submitting manuscripts in clearly understandable English lies with the authors. 
- Many major publishers suggest that EAL authors may wish to use ==an online editing service== presubmission to help reach this goal, and list some contacts for such fee-for-service editing on their websites. 
- Even if you plan to use one of these services, it remains important to ensure that you ==do as much language work as you can== beforehand, to ==ensure your meaning is as clear and unambiguous as possible==, and the English ==follows generally accepted norms==.
-  This work will ==save you money==, as editors usually charge according to the time it takes to edit your manuscript, and also help ==avoid the risk== that an editor may change your meaning inappropriately while “fixing” the English.

- 现在，许多期刊网站都明确规定，作者有责任用清晰易懂的英文提交稿件。许多主要的出版商建议EAL的作者可能希望使用*在线编辑*服务预提交来帮助实现这一目标，并在他们的网站上列出了这种有偿编辑的一些联系方式。
- 即使你计划使用这些服务之一，也要确保你事先做了*尽可能多的语言工作*，确保你的意思尽可能清楚、明确，并且英语遵循普遍接受的规范，这一点仍然很重要。
- 这种工作可以帮你省钱，因为编辑通常是根据编辑稿件的时间来收费的，而且还有助于避免编辑在“修改”英语时不恰当地改变你的意思的风险。

We have two suggestions for your writing in this context:

*我们对你在这种情况下的写作有两点建议:*

- write short sentences first (two clauses only) and join them later if needed; and
	- *先写短句(只写两个从句)，必要时再把它们连接起来*;而且
- aim to develop a repertoire of ways of expressing meanings that are useful in your discipline (a repertoire is a range of possibilities to choose from).
	- *目标是开发一套在你的学科中有用的表达意义的库(一整套方法是可供选择的一系列可能性)。*

The following sections provide some ways to develop your repertoire.下面的部分提供了一些发展您的技能的方法。

## 17.3 Strategic (and acceptable!) language re-use: sentence templates|战略(和可接受的!)语言重用:句子模板

- Recent research on EAL authors writing for publication in English has found that re-using language from other papers in the same field is a common strategy, but there is considerable discussion about when it is acceptable to re-use language, and when the practice crosses into what can be called “textual plagiarism” (Flowerdew & Li 2007). What seems clear is that for science writing there is a divide in the way people think about the content – the science – and the way they think about the language used to express the content. The originality of the work is seen mostly to reside in the content: the data and their analysis and interpretation. This situation differs somewhat from that pertaining to writing in the humanities and social sciences, where the language is seen to form the argument, and therefore the content of the writing. Nevertheless, the very clear convention in academic writing in English is that to avoid the suspicion of plagiarism, authors should use their own words to paraphrase the findings or conclusions of other researchers, as well as citing the source of the information. 
- Here we suggest a way in which EAL and other authors ==can be more confident== about avoiding inappropriate language re-use, while still ==taking advantage of the effective writing of other authors== to develop their own repertoires. 
- This option involves ==the construction of sentence templates for later re-use==. We do this by separating the structure or framework of a sentence from the so-called ==content chunks, the noun phrases==.

*最近对EAL作者用英语写作发表的研究发现，重新使用同一领域其他论文中的语言是一种常见策略，但关于何时可以接受重新使用语言，以及何时这种做法会演变成所谓的“文本剽窃”（Flowerdew&Li，2007），存在大量讨论。显而易见的是，对于科学写作而言，人们对内容（科学）的思考方式以及对表达内容所用语言的思考方式存在分歧。作品的独创性主要体现在内容上：数据及其分析和解释。这种情况与人文科学和社会科学中的写作有所不同，在那里，语言被视为构成论点，因此也构成了写作的内容。然而，英语学术写作中的一个非常明确的惯例是，为了避免抄袭的嫌疑，作者应使用自己的语言来解释其他研究人员的发现或结论，并引用信息来源。在这里，我们建议EAL和其他作者可以更自信地避免不恰当的语言重复使用，同时仍然利用其他作者的有效写作来开发自己的曲目。该选项包括构建句子模板以供以后重复使用。我们通过将句子的结构或框架与所谓的内容块（名词短语）分离来实现这一点。*

To understand this concept, first read the purpose statement quoted, from an article by Li et al (2000) entitled “Water use patterns and agronomic performance for some cropping systems with and without fallow crops in a semi-arid environment of northwest China”, reprinted with permission from Elsevier.

为了理解这一概念，首先阅读Li等人（2000年）的一篇文章中引用的目的声明，该文章题为“中国西北部半干旱环境中有或无休耕作物的某些种植系统的用水模式和农艺性能”，经爱思唯尔许可转载。

> - As part of a long-term research effort aimed at establishing a sustainable rainfed farming system in the semi-arid and sub-humid regions of northwest China, this paper presents a detailed study on the water use patterns and agronomic performance for some cropping systems with and without fallow crops in a semi-arid environment.The objectives of this study were to: 
> 	- (1) determine the grain and aboveground biomass production and water-use efficiency of individual crops grown in the rotation; 
> 	- (2) analyze the seasonal and inter-annual patterns of soil water storage and utilization as well as water stress for the four major rotation crops such as winter wheat, corn, potato and millet; 
> 	- (3) determine the grain and aboveground biomass production and water-use efficiency for different rotation systems and evaluate the capacities of the rotation systems with and without fallow crops to utilize soil water storage in conjunction with seasonal precipitation; 
> 	- (4) establish whether the introduction of fallow crops into the wheat monoculture significantly influences the quantity of water stored in the soil that will be used by the subsequent wheat crop; and 
> 	- (5) discuss the characteristics of soil conservation for different rotation systems.

- *作为在中国西北半干旱半湿润地区建立可持续雨养农业系统的长期研究的一部分，本文详细研究了半干旱环境下有休耕和无休耕的一些种植系统的水分利用模式和农艺性能。
- 本研究的目的是:(1)确定轮作种植的单个作物的粮食和地上生物量产量和水分利用效率;(2)分析冬小麦、玉米、马铃薯和谷子4种轮作作物土壤水分储存利用的季节和年际变化规律及水分胁迫;(3)确定不同轮作系统的粮食和地上生物量产量和水分利用效率，评估有无休耕作物轮作系统结合季节性降水利用土壤储水的能力;(4)确定在小麦单一栽培中引入休耕作物是否显著影响土壤中储存的水的数量，这些水将被后续小麦作物使用;(5)探讨了不同轮作制度下土壤保持的特点。*

If we cross out all the noun phrases that relate just to this particular study, what remains is a series of frameworks that we call sentence templates.

> - As part of a long-term research effort aimed at ~~establishing a sustainable rainfed farming system in the semi-arid and sub-humid regions of northwest China~~, this paper presents a detailed study on ~~the water use patterns and agronomic performance for some cropping systems with and without fallow crops in a semi-arid environment~~.The objectives of this study were to:
> 	- (1) determine ~~the grain and aboveground biomass production and water-use efficiency of individual crops grown in the rotation~~;
> 	- (2) analyze ~~the seasonal and inter-annual patterns of soil water storage and utilization as well as water stress for the four major rotation crops such as winter wheat, corn, potato and millet~~;
> 	- (3) determine ~~the grain and aboveground biomass production and water-use efficiency for different rotation systems and evaluate the capacities of the rotation systems with and without fallow crops to utilize soil water storage in conjunction with seasonal precipitation;~~ 
> 	- (4) establish whether ~~the introduction of fallow crops into the wheat monoculture significantly influences the quantity of water stored in the soil that will be used by the subsequent wheat crop~~; and (5) discuss ~~the characteristics of soil conservation for different rotation systems.~~

The frameworks or templates would look like this (NP = noun phrase).框架或模板看起来像这样(NP =名词短语)。

> As part of a long-term research effort aimed at [NP1], this paper presents [NP2]. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine [NP3]; (2) analyze [NP4]; (3) determine [NP5] and evaluate [NP6]; (4) establish whether [NP7] significantly influences [NP8]; and (5) discuss [NP9].

*作为针对[NP1]的长期研究的一部分，本文提出了[NP2]。本研究的目的是:(1)确定[NP3];(2)分析[NP4];(3)确定[NP5]，评价[NP6];(4)确定[NP7]是否显著影响[NP8];(5)讨论[NP9]。*

N.B. You would only use this template if it enabled you to express the meanings you were trying to make. To help you decide what sorts of meaning they might be, it is useful to list and characterize the noun phrases that you crossed out to make the template, as demonstrated in Table 17.2.

*只有当你能够表达你想要表达的意思时，你才能使用这个模板。为了帮助您确定它们可能是什么类型的含义，列出并描述您划掉的名词短语以制作模板非常有用，如表17.2所示。*

## 17.4 More about noun phrases 

### Discipline-specific noun phrase 专业名词短语构

- ==Discipline-specific noun phrases== make up a very important part of the writing you need to do about your research. 
- ==Identifying and learning them accurately== is a very useful strategy for improving your writing. 
- Here we present some ==grammatical details== about noun phrases, and highlight one area of common difficulty associated with them.

*专业名词短语构成了你需要做的关于你的研究的写作的一个非常重要的部分。准确地识别和学习它们是提高写作的一个非常有用的策略。在这里，我们将介绍一些名词短语的语法细节，并强调与它们相关的一个共同难点。*

==A noun phrase== is a group of words that does not include ==a finite verb== (i.e. does not include a verb with a subject), built up around ==a single headword==, which determines the grammatical relationships of the noun phrase to other elements of the sentence.The headwords are italicized in the following examples:

*名词短语是一组不包含限定动词(即不包含带主语的动词)的单词，围绕一个中心词建立起来，中心词决定了名词短语与句子其他元素的语法关系。在以下例子中，标题用斜体显示:*

>- *the mechanisms* of salt marsh succession;盐沼演替机制;
>- *interactions* involving carbohydrates; and 碳水化合物相互作用;而且
>- the seasonal and inter-annual *patterns* of soil water storage and utilization.土壤水分储存和利用的季节和年际变化规律。

Note that long noun phrases can be made up of several smaller noun phrases, often joined together with prepositions.

*注意，长名词短语可以由几个较小的名词短语组成，通常与介词连在一起。*

### A special case: noun–noun phrases

- This kind of noun phrase can cause problems for EAL writers, in our experience.
	- An example of a noun–noun phrase is “resource availability.” 
		- This phrase means “availability of resources.” 
		- To ==shorten phrases== like this, it is very common in scientific English for ==the second part== (of resources) to be ==moved in front of the headword== (availability). 
		- When this happens, the part that moves is generally written in its ==singular form== (resource) and the ==preposition is omitted==. (It is rare to find a possessive form with an apostrophe in such cases in science writing.) 
	- Similarly, “carbohydrate interactions” means “interactions involving carbohydrates.”
	- Table 17.3 contains some more examples, taken from the Provided Example Articles (PEAs).

*根据我们的经验，这种名词短语可能会给EAL作者带来问题。名词-名词短语的一个例子是“资源可用性”。这个短语的意思是“资源的可用性”（availability of resources）。为了缩短这样的短语，在科学英语中，第二部分（resources）被移到标题词（availability）前面是很常见的。当这种情况发生时，移动的部分通常以单数形式（resource）书写，介词被省略。（在这种情况下，在科学写作中很少发现带有撇号的所有格形式。）同样，“碳水化合物相互作用”是指“涉及碳水化合物的相互作用”。*

A good way to remember this construction is the following example:

记住这种结构的一个好方法是以下示例：

> food for *dogs* is *dog food*

**Note the difference in the usage of singular and plural word forms in the two forms of the phrases.** We suggest that you make a list of the noun–noun phrases you see used repeatedly in articles in your field, and learn them accurately, including whether the forms are singular or plural. This will help improve the accuracy of your writing considerably.

*注意在这两种短语中单数和复数形式的用法的区别。我们建议你把在你的专业领域的文章中反复出现的名名词短语列一个清单，并准确地学习它们，包括它们的形式是单数还是复数。这将大大提高你写作的准确性。*

### Using the noun phrase concept to read about unfamiliar areas of science

- To summarize Sections 17.3 and 17.4, ==science writing== is largely made up of ==sentence structures (templates)==, which are usable for many different areas of science, ==plus noun phrases==, which are often specific to particular areas. 
- Once you understand this concept, you will probably find it easier to read articles from areas of science with which you are not completely familiar. 
- *【strategies]*
	- This is because you can ==skip over the unfamiliar noun phrases== on your first reading, just ==concentrating on== the sentence structures and ==main meanings==. 
	- Then you can identify which noun phrases ==recur frequently==, and use a ==dictionary== or website to find out their meanings, if you need to know them. This will depend on your reason for reading the article. 
	- If you need to ==understand more== about the area of research and are new to it, then you will probably need to ==look up many noun phrases==. 
	- If you are reading the article only to ==find one specific piece of information==, perhaps about the use of a method, you will need to ==look up fewer noun phrases==. 
	- As you make your decisions about which ones to look up, remember to identify the headword of each noun phrase first, as this is the most important part for the sentence meaning.

*总结第17.3和17.4节，科学写作主要由句子结构(模板)和名词短语组成，这些句子结构适用于许多不同的科学领域，而名词短语通常适用于特定的领域。一旦你理解了这个概念，你可能会发现阅读你不完全熟悉的科学领域的文章会更容易。这是因为在第一次阅读时，你可以跳过不熟悉的名词短语，只关注句子结构和主要意思。然后你可以识别哪些名词短语经常出现，如果你需要了解它们，可以使用字典或网站找出它们的意思。这取决于你阅读这篇文章的原因。如果你需要对研究领域有更多的了解，而且是新手，那么你可能需要查阅很多名词短语。如果你阅读这篇文章只是为了找到一条特定的信息，也许是关于一种方法的使用，那么你需要查找的名词短语就会更少。当你决定要查哪个词的时候，记得先找出每个名词短语的词头，因为这是句子意义最重要的部分。*

The noun phrase idea can also help you to complete exercises in this book that involve writing about areas of science that are unfamiliar to you. For example, for readers who are unfamiliar with molecular biology and plant physiology, the PEA by Kaiser et al (2003) (Chapter 19) may be challenging to read. Skipping over the complex noun phrases and focusing on the sentence structures will enable you to more easily do the exercises and understand the main point we are trying to teach. Of course, the same is true for the PEA by Britton-Simmons and Abbot (2008) (Chapter 20), for readers who are unfamiliar with marine biology studies, or that by Ganci et al (2012) (Chapter 21) for those unfamiliar with computer modelling and volcano studies.

*名词短语的概念还可以帮助你完成书中涉及你所不熟悉的科学领域的练习。例如，对于不熟悉分子生物学和植物生理学的读者，Kaiser et al(2003)(第19章)的PEA可能是具有挑战性的阅读。跳过复杂的名词短语，把注意力集中在句子结构上，这样你就能更容易地完成练习，理解我们要教授的要点。当然，对于不熟悉海洋生物学研究的读者来说，Britton-Simmons和Abbot(2008)的PEA(第20章)也是如此，对于不熟悉计算机建模和火山研究的读者来说，Ganci等人(2012)的PEA(第21章)也是如此。*

## 17.5 Concordancing: a tool for developing your discipline-specific English|Concordancing:一种提高专业英语水平的工具

All languages contain words and phrases that are commonly associated with other words or phrases (e.g. theory and practice; genetically modified organisms; the effect of something on something else). These collocations (words that are commonly used together) can be identified and studied. If you want to identify and learn common collocations that are used in writing about your own research field, you need to study texts (examples of writing) specific to that field. In this section we introduce a type of software program that can help you do this in a systematic way: a concordancer.

所有语言都包含通常与其他单词或短语相关的单词和短语(如理论和实践;转基因生物;某物对另一物的影响)。这些搭配(经常一起使用的单词)可以被识别和研究。如果你想识别和学习在你自己的研究领域的写作中使用的常见搭配，你需要研究特定于该领域的文本(写作示例)。在本节中，我们将介绍一种软件程序，它可以帮助您系统地做到这一点:concordancer。

A concordancer searches a group of texts (called a corpus) for all examples of a particular search item. It displays the results as lines of text across the screen, with the search term highlighted in the middle. Results can be sorted according to what is on the left or right of the search term (and one, two, or three words away from the search term), and this can provide data for your language learning. If the corpus you search is specific to your research field, you can search it in this way to improve your use of discipline-specific English.

索引舞者在一组文本(称为语料库)中搜索特定搜索项的所有示例。它在屏幕上以文本行的形式显示搜索结果，搜索词在中间突出显示。搜索结果可以根据搜索词的左侧或右侧(以及距离搜索词1、2或3个单词)进行排序，这可以为您的语言学习提供数据。如果你搜索的语料库是特定于你的研究领域的，你可以用这种方法来搜索它，以提高你对特定学科英语的使用。

In the following section, we first provide an example of what can be learned from a concordancing search of a discipline-specific corpus (Task 17.4), and then explain how you can download a freeware concordancing program called AdTAT from the Internet, and also construct your own discipline-specific corpus.

在下一节中，我们首先提供一个示例，说明可以从特定于学科的语料库(Task 17.4)的索引搜索中学到什么，然后解释如何从Internet下载一个名为AdTAT的免费软件索引程序，以及如何构建自己的特定于学科的语料库。

Task 17.4 Getting familiar with concordancing|任务17.4熟悉索引

Look at the AdTAT search results below, obtained by searching for the term “soil” in a corpus of articles from the field of soil science. Then read the questions and answers that follow.

看看下面的AdTAT搜索结果，它是通过在土壤科学领域的文章中搜索术语“土壤”获得的。然后阅读下面的问题和答案。

Q1  Is soil countable, uncountable, or both in these examples?
在这些例子中，土壤是可数的，不可数的，还是两者都是?

A1 Both. Countable examples include “a soil with a high P sorption capacity” and “9 different pasture soils”; an uncountable usage can be seen in “samples of soil were weighed.”

A1。可列举的例子包括“一种具有高磷吸附能力的土壤”和“9种不同的牧场土壤”;在“称重土壤样品”中可以看到数不清的用法。

Some of these usages are different from those found in everyday English, where soil is always uncountable. From this example, you can get an idea of how an AdTAT search of a discipline-specific text collection can help you identify English usages that are specific to that discipline.

其中一些用法与日常英语中的用法不同，在日常英语中，soil总是不可数的。从这个示例中，您可以了解特定于学科的文本集合的AdTAT搜索如何帮助您识别特定于该学科的英语用法。

Q2 How many different ways is the word soil used in these examples?在这些例子中，soil这个词有多少种不同的用法?

A2 Quite a few! For example, as well as its usage as a countable and uncountable noun, it is used in noun–noun phrases, both as the headword (“pasture soils”) and as the adjective-equivalent (“soil water”), and in hyphenated adjectival constructions (“soil-stored water”) and noun–noun phrases (“soil–plant microcosm”).

A2相当多!例如，除了用作可数名词和不可数名词外，它还用于名名词短语中，既用作词头(“牧场土壤”)，也用作形容词对应词(“土壤水”)，还用于形容词连字符结构(“土壤储存的水”)和名名词短语(“土壤-植物微观世界”)。

### Using AdTAT software
AdTAT is a concordancing program developed by a team at the University of Adelaide and freely downloadable from the Internet at http://www.adelaide.edu.au/red/adtat/. The program is Java-based, small in size, and easy to learn, yet can quickly perform the searches needed to answer EAL writers’ questions about language usage.

AdTAT是阿德莱德大学的一个团队开发的一个索引程序，可从互联网上免费下载，网址是http://www.adelaide.edu.au/red/adtat/。该程序是基于java的，体积小，易于学习，但可以快速执行搜索，以回答EAL作者关于语言使用的问题。

Our suggestion is that you construct a corpus (meaning body in Latin, but in this case a special-purpose collection) of English language journal articles from your own discipline(s), so you can search it for the use of words or phrases you need in your scientific writing. This will provide data, on your own desktop, for your ongoing learning of the specific English phrases and expressions used in your discipline.

我们的建议是，您可以构建一个语料库(在拉丁语中是主体的意思，但在本例中是一个特殊目的的集合)，收集您所属学科的英语期刊文章，这样您就可以在其中搜索您在科学写作中需要的单词或短语的使用。这将在你自己的桌面上为你正在学习的特定英语短语和表达提供数据。

### Making a corpus|制作语料库

To be most useful, a corpus needs to consist of documents from your own subdiscipline, and of the type you are aiming to write. For example, a useful corpus for EAL scientists wanting to write articles for international publication would be 20–30 published research articles in their particular field. Our suggestion is that the articles to be used for a corpus be selected or approved by supervisors or leaders of research groups, to ensure that

为了发挥最大的作用，语料库需要由来自您自己的子学科的文档和您打算编写的类型的文档组成。例如，对于想要为国际出版物写文章的EAL科学家来说，一个有用的语料库应该是20-30篇在他们特定领域发表的研究文章。我们的建议是，作为语料库的文章，应由课题组的主管或组长选择或批准，以确保

- they are from reputable journals in the field; 它们来自该领域的著名期刊;
- they are well-written, by authors using English as a first language or at a comparable level; 它们写得很好，作者以英语为第一语言或具有相当水平;
- they cover a suitable range of subtopics within the field, to give a good range of language usage; and 它们涵盖了该领域内适当范围的子主题，以提供良好的语言使用范围;而且
- they cover the required range of types of writing (e.g. including or excluding review articles, as desired). 它们涵盖了所需的写作类型(例如，根据需要包括或不包括评论文章)。

### Preparing documents for a corpus

To be searchable by a concordancing program, the texts must be saved in text-only format (.txt). If you can download the articles in html format, saving the file as text-only (.txt) is a straightforward operation. Alternatively, if the selected articles are available in Microsoft Word format (e.g. if the author is willing to provide the text in this format), then the same process is possible. In both cases, delete the tables and figures, the author biodata, and the reference lists before saving as .txt files.If the articles are in .pdf format, then a somewhat tedious set of steps needs to be followed: see below for details. All files should be placed in a single folder on your computer for ease of searching.

为了被索引程序搜索，文本必须保存为纯文本格式(.txt)。如果您可以下载html格式的文章，那么将文件保存为纯文本(.txt)是一个简单的操作。或者，如果所选文章是以Microsoft Word格式提供的(例如，如果作者愿意以这种格式提供文本)，那么同样的过程是可能的。在这两种情况下，删除表格和图表、作者生物数据和参考列表，然后再保存为.txt文件。如果文章是.pdf格式的，那么需要遵循一组有些繁琐的步骤:参见下面的详细信息。所有的文件应该放在一个文件夹在您的计算机上，以方便搜索。

### Copyright issues|版权问题
Making a single electronic copy for use with a concordancer is comparable to making a single copy for research use.制作一份用于协和舞者的电子拷贝与制作一份用于研究的拷贝是相当的。

### Training
Notes on how to use AdTAT are available from the book’s companion website and in the Help files in the program.

关于如何使用AdTAT的说明可以从该书的配套网站和程序的帮助文件中找到。

### Preparing text in pdf format for concordancing|为索引准备pdf格式的文本
A copy/paste procedure must be followed to convert the text to a text-only format.Only the written part of the article is needed, so do not copy biodata, tables and figures, reference lists, or acknowledgements, and do not include the headers or footers on the pages. The conversion process may require some trial and error at the beginning.

必须遵循复制/粘贴过程将文本转换为纯文本格式。只需要文章的书面部分，所以不要复制生物数据，表格和图表，参考列表，或确认，也不要包括页眉或页脚。转换过程在开始时可能需要一些尝试和错误。

- Download the file (if online).下载该文件(如果在线)。
- Open the file in Adobe Acrobat Reader. 在adobe acrobat reader中打开文件。
- Select as much text as you can without including unwanted items such as headers and footers, page numbers, tables/figures, or the reference list.选择尽可能多的文本，但不要包含不需要的项目，如页眉和页脚、页码、表格/图表或参考列表。
- Copy the text (Ctrl + C). 复制文本(Ctrl + C)。
- Open your word processor (such as Microsoft Word). 打开文字处理器(如Microsoft word)。
- Paste the text into a new document (Ctrl + V).  将文本粘贴到新文档中(Ctrl + V)。
- Repeat the steps of selecting, copying, and pasting until all the relevant parts of the paper are copied.重复选择、复制和粘贴的步骤，直到将纸张的所有相关部分复制完成。
- Select the Save as… option from the File menu in your word processor. 从字处理器的“文件”菜单中选择“另存为…”选项。
- In the next window, choose Text only as the file format and name the file before saving. 在下一个窗口中，选择Text only作为文件格式，并在保存之前命名文件。
- Edit the text file as necessary (remove unwanted material). 根据需要编辑文本文件(删除不需要的内容)。

Some pdf files have security measures embedded to prevent copying. Nothing can be done with these files. If Copy or Paste functions do not work, this is the cause. Care must always be taken not to copy the headers, footers, and page numbers into the new file. We find that the easiest method in the long term is copying the text from one page or column, pasting into a word processor, then repairing the text so that it is restored to its original continuous flow (deleting unwanted spaces in sentences, etc.). This avoids copying the unwanted parts from the outset. The whole process seems tedious at first, but becomes an almost mechanical routine with practice.

有些pdf文件内嵌了防止复制的安全措施。这些文件是没用的。如果复制或粘贴功能不起作用，这就是原因。一定要注意不要将页眉、页脚和页码复制到新文件中。我们发现，从长远来看，最简单的方法是从一页或一列复制文本，粘贴到文字处理器中，然后修复文本，使其恢复到原始的连续流(删除句子中不需要的空格，等等)。这样可以避免从一开始就复制不需要的部分。整个过程一开始似乎很乏味，但随着练习，几乎变成了机械的例行公事。

## 17.6 Using the English articles (a/an, the) appropriately in science writing|在科技写作中适当使用英文冠词(a/an, the)

For many of you who use EAL, the problem of using articles appropriately has been a constant since your early days of English learning. You may have seen the rules explained in many different ways, and learned them over and over again. You may be wondering why we have chosen to discuss this issue again here. We have included a section on article usage precisely because it is so difficult to master, especially for EAL users whose home language does not contain articles, and because it is often highlighted by journal editors and referees as needing attention in submitted manuscripts.

对于许多使用EAL的人来说，恰当地使用文章的问题从你们学习英语的早期就一直存在。您可能已经看到过以多种不同方式解释的规则，并且一遍又一遍地学习它们。你可能想知道为什么我们选择在这里再次讨论这个问题。我们加入了文章使用的部分，正是因为它很难掌握，特别是对于母语中没有文章的EAL用户，也因为它经常被期刊编辑和审稿人强调为提交的稿件中需要注意的部分。

Indeed, in our experience editors and referees who speak English as a first language, and who therefore learned article usage by immersion “at their mother’s knee,” may have limited understanding of the complexity of this part of the English language system. This complexity is reflected in the fact that effective computer software to identify or correct article errors has not yet, to our knowledge, been developed. This lack reflects the degree to which the use of English articles with any noun phrase depends on the meaning of the phrase in its particular context in the sentence, especially whether the noun phrase is used there in a generic sense or a specific sense. This question (generic or specific) relates also to the problems of meaning that can occur when articles are used inappropriately. It is therefore with the generic/specific question that we begin our discussion of article use.

事实上，根据我们的经验，把英语作为第一语言的编辑和裁判，因此通过“在母亲的膝盖上”浸入式学习了文章的用法，可能对英语语言系统这部分的复杂性理解有限。这种复杂性反映在这样一个事实上:据我们所知，有效的计算机软件还没有开发出来，以识别或纠正文章错误。这种缺失反映了英语冠词中任何名词短语的使用在多大程度上取决于该短语在句子中特定上下文中的意义，尤其是该名词短语是在一般意义上还是在特定意义上使用的。这个问题(一般的或具体的)也与冠词使用不当时可能出现的意义问题有关。因此，我们从一般/具体问题开始讨论冠词的用法。

### Generic noun phrases|一般名词短语

Generic noun phrases refer to any – or all – members of a particular class or category of living things, objects, or concepts. There are four ways to write these generic noun phrases in English:

- 一般名词短语指的是某一类或某一类生物、物体或概念的任何成员或所有成员。英语中一般名词短语有四种写法:
	- 1 If the noun is countable, you can make it generic by writing it in its plural form and not using any article.*如果一个名词是可数名词，你可以用**它的复数形式而不使用冠词**来表示一般名词。*
	- 2 An alternative when the noun is countable is to make it generic by using its singular form with the article a or an.*当名词是可数名词时，另一种选择是**用它的单数形式与冠词a或An连用**，使其泛型。*
		- >e.g. <u>Healthy crops</u> can contribute substantial cadmium to<u> human diets.</u>*健康的作物可以为人类的饮食提供大量的镉。*
		- > <u>A healthy crop</u> can contribute substantial cadmium to human diets.
	- 3 When the noun you want to use is uncountable, you make it generic by omitting any article. (Remember: uncountable nouns never have a plural form.)*当你想用的名词是**不可数名词时，可以省略冠词**，使之成为一般名词。(记住:不可数名词从来没有复数形式。)*
		- >e.g. Cadmium exists in soils in many forms. *镉以多种形式存在于土壤中。*
		- >Manipulation of soil pH can be effective in managing Cd contamination. *控制土壤pH值可以有效地治理镉污染。*
	- 4 English has another possible way of making generic noun phrases which you need to recognize. Sometimes, ==a singular countable noun carries the generic meaning== when used with the definite article the. This is often used when referring to living things or common machinery or equipment. (It is usually also possible to substitute the plural form of the word without an article, also changing the verb to agree, of course.)
		- *英语中还有另一种制造一般名词短语的方法，你需要识别它们。有时，**单数可数名词与定冠词the连用时具有一般意义**。这个短语通常用来指生物或普通的机器或设备。(通常也可以用不加冠词的复数形式代替，当然也可以用动词agree代替。)*
		- > e.g. ==The earthworm== can be found in many types of soil. (or Earthworms can…) 
		- *例:==蚯蚓==可以在多种土壤中找到。*
		- ==The computer== has become an important tool for researchers. (or Computers have…)
		- *计算机已经成为研究人员的重要工具。(或者Computers have…)*

N.B. For science writing in particular, it is important to remember that as long as you continue talking about a noun as a concept or general class (any or all of them), the noun stays generic (i.e. you may have to unlearn the general rule that says a noun is specific after it has been used once in a passage of writing). Complete Task 17.6 now.

*注意:尤其对于科学写作，重要的是要记住，只要你继续==把一个名词作为一个概念或一般类(任何或所有)来讨论，这个名词就保持泛型==(即你可能不得不忘记一个名词在一篇文章中使用了一次之后是特定的这个一般规则)。现在完成任务17.6。*

Task 17.6 Generic noun phrases一般名词短语

In the first paragraph of the Introduction to the PEA by Kaiser et al (2003), reproduced here, underline examples of generic noun phrases using both countable and uncountable nouns.

在Kaiser et al(2003)的《PEA简介》(Introduction to PEA)的第一段(此处转载)中，有一些既使用可数名词又使用不可数名词的一般名词短语。

- **泛指**
- ==特指==

**Legumes** form **symbiotic associations** with **N2-fixing soil-borne bacteria** of the Rhizobium family. ==The symbiosis== begins when **compatible bacteria** invade **legume root hairs**, signalling the division of **inner cortical root cells** and the formation of **a nodule**. **Invading bacteria** migrate to the developing nodule by way of **an ‘infection thread’**, comprised of **an invaginated cell wall**. In the inner cortex, **bacteria** are released into the cell cytosol, enveloped in **a modified plasma membrane** (the peribacteroid membrane (PBM)), to form **an organelle-like structure** called **the symbiosome**, which consists of bacteroid, PBM and the intervening peribacteroid space (PBS; Whitehead and Day, 1997). The bacteria, subsequently, differentiate into the N2-fixing bacteroid form. The symbiosis allows the access of **legumes** to **atmospheric N2**, which is reduced to **NH4 +** by the bacteroid enzyme **nitrogenase**. In **exchange** for **reduced N**, the plant provides **carbon** to **the nodules** to support bacterial respiration, **a low-oxygen environment** in the nodule suitable for **bacteroid nitrogenase activity**, and all the essential nutritional elements necessary for bacteroid activity. Consequently, **nutrient transport** across the PBM is **an important control mechanism** in the promotion and regulation of the symbiosis.

*豆科植物与根瘤菌家族中固结n2的土壤细菌形成共生关系。当兼容的细菌侵入豆科植物的根毛时，共生就开始了，这标志着内部皮层根细胞的分裂和结节的形成。入侵的细菌通过“感染线”(由内陷的细胞壁组成)迁移到正在发育的结节中。在内皮层，细菌被释放到细胞质中，被修饰过的质膜(类菌周膜(PBM))包裹，形成一种称为共生体的细胞器状结构，由类细菌、PBM和中间的类菌周空间(PBS;Whitehead和Day, 1997)。随后，细菌分化为固定n2的类细菌形式。这种共生关系使豆科植物能够接触到大气中的N2，而N2被类菌酶氮化酶还原为NH4 +。作为交换，植物向结核提供碳以支持细菌呼吸，结核中的低氧环境适合类细菌氮化酶活性，以及类细菌活性所必需的所有营养元素。因此，营养物质在PBM间的转运是促进和调节共生的重要控制机制。*

### Specific noun phrases||特定名词短语

Specific noun phrases refer to particular, individual members of a class or category, rather than the class as a whole. The reader and the writer both know already which one or ones of the noun are being referred to. This requires the use of specific noun phrases, which involve the definite article the. There are three different reasons why a specific noun phrase may be required:

特定名词短语指的是一个类或类别中特定的个体成员，而不是整个类。读者和作者都已经知道这个名词指的是哪一个或哪一个。这就需要使用特定的名词短语，其中包含定冠词the。

有==三个不同的原因==可以解释为什么==需要使用一个特定的名词短语==:
- 1 The noun phrase is specific because the phrase is referring to shared or assumed knowledge of one particular referent (= the thing being referred to).*名词短语是**具体的**，因为这个短语指的是**对一个特定的指物**(被指的事物)共有的或假定的知识。*
	- >e.g. In recent years the growth of desert areas has been accelerating in the world.*例:近年来，世界上沙漠地区的增长一直在加速。*
- 2 *【前指】* The noun phrase may be specific because the phrase is pointing back to old information already introduced to the reader.*名词短语可能是**具体的**，因为这个短语指向已经介绍给读者的**旧信息**。*
	- >e.g. A pot experiment was conducted in an acid soil. The experiment showed… *名词短语可能是具体的，因为这个短语指向已经介绍给读者的旧信息。*
- 3 *【后照应】* The noun phrase is specific because the phrase is pointing forward to information that specifies which one or ones are being referred to. *名词短语是**特定的**，因为这个短语指向的信息指明了**它指的是哪一个或哪几个**。*
	- >e.g. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of liming on Cd uptake.*例:本研究的目的是调查石灰对Cd吸收的影响。*

![[Pasted image 20221125105431.png]]

N.B. It is worth noting that when the structure NP1 + of + NP2 is used, the first noun phrase will be specific (i.e. have the in front of it) about 85% of the time. It is therefore a good idea to always use the in this situation, unless you are very sure that the extended noun phrase (the two noun phrases joined with of ) is generic for some reason. Do Task 17.7 now.

值得注意的是，当使用+ NP2的NP1 +结构时，第一个名词短语在85%的情况下是具体的(即前面有the)。因此，在这种情况下总是使用the是一个好主意，除非你非常确定扩展的名词短语(与of连用的两个名词短语)出于某种原因是通用的。现在执行任务17.7。

```
Task 17.7 Specific noun phrases|任务17.7特定的名词短语
Reread the Introduction paragraph from the PEA by Kaiser et al (2003) and draw a square around each specific noun phrase. Discuss with a colleague why each one is specific.
重读Kaiser et al(2003)的PEA的引言段落，在每个特定的名词短语周围画一个正方形。和同事讨论为什么每一个都是具体的。

### Summary flow chart for deciding on article use|决定物品用途的总结流程图

Many EAL writers find the flow chart presented in Figure 17.1 helpful when they have to decide which form of the article to use with a noun phrase in a particular sentence (Task 17.8).许多EAL作者发现，当他们必须决定在一个特定的句子中使用名词短语时，图17.1所示的流程图很有帮助(任务17.8)。

___ propagule pressure is widely recognized as  _an__  important factor that influences ___ invasion success. ___ previous studies【泛指】 suggest that _the__ probability of ___ successful invasion increases with _the__ number of propagules released, with __the_ number of introduction attempts, with ___ introduction rate【泛指】, and with ___ proximity to ___ existing populations【泛指】 of invaders. Moreover, ___ propagule pressure may influence ___ invasion dynamics after ___ establishment by affecting __the_ capacity of ___ non-native species to adapt to their new environment. Despite its acknowledged importance, ___ propagule pressure has rarely been manipulated experimentally and _the__ interaction of ___ propagule pressure with ___ other processes that ==regulate== ___ invasion success is not well understood.

繁殖压力

*繁殖压力被广泛认为是影响入侵成功的重要因素。先前的研究表明，随着繁殖体数量的增加，引入尝试的次数的增加，引入率的增加，以及与现有入侵种群的接近程度的增加，入侵成功的可能性的增加。此外，繁殖压力可能通过影响非本地物种适应新环境的能力来影响植物建立后的入侵动态。尽管繁殖压力的重要性得到了承认，但很少有人在实验上对其进行控制，而且繁殖压力与其他==调节==入侵成功的过程之间的相互作用也没有很好地理解。*

## 17.7 Using “which” and “that”

- Problems with the relative pronouns ==which and that==, and ==whether to use commas== with them, are a common error we see in editing scientists’ writing. The explanation here is designed to help you understand and remember how these two words are used.
- *关系代词which和that的问题，以及是否在它们之间使用逗号，是我们在编辑科学家的著作时常见的错误。这里的解释旨在帮助你理解和记住这两个词是如何使用的。*

>Example 1: Land which is surrounded by water is an island.被水包围的土地是岛屿。

The italicized portion of Example 1 is the relative clause. In this example, the relative clause is essential to the meaning of the sentence, because if it were omitted the sentence would read “Land is an island.” This does not make sense, because only land which is surrounded by water is called an island. Thus the relative clause defines which land the sentence refers to: it is a defining (or restrictive) relative clause.

*例1中斜体部分是关系子句。在这个例子中，关系从句对句子的意义至关重要，因为如果省略它，句子就会变成“土地是一个岛”。这是说不通的，因为只有被水包围的土地才被称为岛屿。因此，**关系分句定义了句子所指的土地:它是一个限定(或限制性)关系分句。***

The important points to note about defining relative clauses are as follows.在定义关系从句时要注意的要点如下。

- ==Practice differs== in terms of the relative pronoun that can begin a defining clause. Some writers (and teachers of writing) feel comfortable with ==either which or that==. Others permit only that in this clause type. However, the publisher of your accepted article may have ==in-house rules== on this topic.
	- *在定语从句开始使用关系代词方面，实践是不同的。有些作家(和写作老师)对这个或那个感到舒服。其他的只允许在此子句类型中这样做。然而，你所接受的文章的出版商可能有关于这个主题的内部规则。*
- ==Defining clauses have no commas separating== them from the rest of the sentence in which they are placed. 
	- *定语从句没有逗号将它们与所在句子的其余部分隔开*。

> Example 2: Tasmania, which is surrounded by the waters of Bass Strait, is an island of great natural beauty.例2:塔斯马尼亚岛被巴斯海峡的海水包围，是一个自然风光秀丽的岛屿

In this example, the relative clause is not essential to the basic meaning of the sentence. If it were omitted, the sentence would read “Tasmania is an island of great natural beauty,” and this makes sense. The relative clause is adding extra, non-essential information and is thus a non-defining (non-restrictive) relative clause. Another way to work out if a relative clause is non-defining is to try inserting the phrase “by the way” after the which. If this addition sounds acceptable, the clause is non-defining.

*在这个例子中，关系子句对句子的基本含义来说不是必不可少的。如果省略了它，这句话将是“塔斯马尼亚是一个自然美丽的岛屿”，这是有道理的。相对子句添加了额外的、非必要的信息，因此是一个非限定性（非限制性）相对子句。另一种确定相对子句是否为非定义子句的方法是尝试在which之后插入短语“顺便”。如果这个附加条款听起来可以接受，那么这个条款是不明确的。*

The points to note about non-defining relative clauses are these:关于非限定性相关条款，需要注意以下几点：

- They are ==separated== from the rest of their sentence ==by commas==: two commas if they occur in the middle of the sentence as in our example, or one comma if they come at the end of a sentence.
	- *它们用逗号与句子的其余部分隔开:如果它们出现在句子中间，就像我们的例子中一样，用两个逗号;如果它们出现在句末，就用一个逗号。*
- They can only begin with which.他们只能从which开始。
- N.B. The same distinction regarding punctuation holds when the which/that + verb is omitted, forming a phrase.*注意:省略which/that +动词构成短语时，标点符号也有同样的区别。*
	- > Examples: Tasmania, surrounded by the waters of Bass Strait, is an island of great natural beauty.
	- Land surrounded by water is an island.
