SECTION 2 
When and how to write each article section

Because the results govern the content and structure of the whole article, 
- it is important to be as clear as possible about the main points of your results “story” at the beginning of the writing process. 
- We suggest that your first task when preparing to write a paper is 
	- to identify from your results ==a clearly connected story== 
		- which leads to one or more “take-home messages.” 
- This term refers to what readers remember after they have put the paper down: 
	- what they talk to their colleagues about over a cup of coffee next day, for example.

*因为结果决定了整篇文章的内容和结构，所以在写作过程开始时，尽可能清楚地说明结果“故事”的要点是很重要的。我们建议，在准备写论文时，你的首要任务是从你的==结果中找出一个明确相连的故事==，从而引出一个或多个“带回家的信息”。这个词指的是读者在放下论文后的记忆：例如，他们第二天喝杯咖啡时与同事谈论的内容。*

To move towards this clear story, 
- focus on your tables and figures first. 
	- For each one, write a list of one or two ==bullet points highlighting the main message==(s) of the data presented. 
	- Next to each bullet point, indicate whether the point ==contributes to the Results or Discussion sections==, or both. 
		- Some points may also ==stimulate thoughts== for inclusion in the ==Introduction or Methods sections==; 
		- mark the points to indicate this. 
	- Sort the figures and tables into the ==best order== to connect the pieces of the story together. 
	- Draft some bullet points into a list to form ==a take-home message==. 
	- Then sit down with all your co-authors and discuss the story of the paper that you will write. Aim to reach agreement on:

*要实现这个清晰的故事，首先要关注你的表格和数字。对于每一个，写一个或两个要点的列表，突出显示所呈现数据的主要信息。在每个项目符号旁边，指出该点是否有助于“结果”或“讨论”部分，或两者兼而有之。一些观点也可能会激发人们的想法，将其纳入导言或方法部分；标记点以表明这一点。把数字和表格按最佳顺序排列，把故事的各个部分联系在一起。在列表中草拟一些要点，形成一个带回家的信息。然后坐下来与你的所有合著者讨论你将要写的论文的故事。旨在就以下事项达成一致：*

- **which data should be included; 应包括哪些数据；**
- **what are the important points that form the story of the paper; and构成论文故事的要点是什么**；和
- **what is/are the take-home message or messages.什么是带回家的消息**。

This is also a good time to decide on who will be listed as authors of the paper (see Section 15.1 for more details), and to discuss potential target journals, taking into consideration the points raised in Section 1.2. Once these foundation steps are completed, you are ready to begin writing the various sections of the manuscript itself.

这也是决定谁将被列为论文作者的好时机（详见第15.1节），并讨论潜在的目标期刊，同时考虑第1.2节中提出的观点。一旦这些基础步骤完成，您就可以开始撰写稿件的各个部分了。

We have found Task 4.1 useful in helping authors identify some key information that will help them begin the drafting process.
我们发现任务4.1有助于作者确定一些关键信息，帮助他们开始起草过程。

Once you can answer these questions for your own results, you are ready to refine your tables and figures so that they present, as clearly and forcefully as possible, the data that support the components of your story. That refinement process is the topic of Chapter 5.

一旦你能够为自己的结果回答这些问题，你就可以完善你的表格和图表，使它们尽可能清晰有力地呈现支持你的故事组成部分的数据。这个细化过程是第五章的主题。

## Task 4.1 Questions to focus the drafting process|起草过程中需要关注的问题

Answer these four questions, in English even if it is not your first language, for the results you want to turn into a paper:用英语回答这四个问题，即使这不是你的第一语言，你想把结果变成论文：

1 What do my results say? (two sentences maximum, a very brief summary of the main points, no background!) **1我的结果是什么？**（最多两句话，非常简短地概括了要点，没有背景！）

2 What do these results mean in their context? (i.e. what conclusions can be drawn from these results?) **2这些结果在其上下文中意味着什么？**（即从这些结果中可以得出什么结论？）

3 Who needs to know about these results? (i.e. who specifically form the audience for this paper you are going to write?) **3谁需要知道这些结果？**（即，你将要撰写的这篇论文的受众是谁？）

4 Why do they need to know? (i.e. what contribution will the results make to ongoing work in the field? Or, what will other researchers be missing if they have not read your paper?)**4为什么他们需要知道？**（即，研究结果对该领域正在进行的工作有什么贡献？或者，如果其他研究人员没有读过你的论文，他们会错过什么？）
