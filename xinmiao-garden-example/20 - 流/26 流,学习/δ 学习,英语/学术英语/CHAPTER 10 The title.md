The title you finally select for your manuscript forms an important part of your communication with your ==readers==, both with ==the editor and referees== who will evaluate the paper, and with ==the members of your discipline community== whom you want to read the paper after its publication. From the reviewer criteria we considered in Chapter 3, we know it is important that the title clearly indicates the content of the paper, but there are various ways in which that can be achieved. In this chapter, we look at advice about attracting the attention of your target readers effectively.

*你最终为你的手稿选择的标题是你与读者交流的重要组成部分，无论是与评估论文的编辑和裁判，还是与你希望在论文发表后阅读的学科团体成员。根据我们在第3章中考虑的评审标准，我们知道标题清楚地表明论文的内容是很重要的，但有多种方式可以实现这一点。在本章中，我们将探讨如何有效吸引目标读者的注意力。*

## 10.1 Strategy 1: Provide as much relevant information as possible, but be concise|提供尽可能多的相关信息，但要简明扼要

The purpose of a title is to attract busy readers in your particular target audience, so that they will want to access (download) and read the whole document. 

==The more revealing== your title is, ==the more easily== your potential readers can ==judge how relevant== your paper is to their interests. 

To exemplify the importance of this issue, we quote from relevant Author Guidelines: 

- 1.the Journal of Ecology asks for “a concise and informative title (as short as possible)” (www.blackwellpublishing.com/ submit.asp?ref=0022-0477&site=1); 
- 2.the New Phytologist stipulates a concise and informative title (for research papers, ideally stating the key finding or framing a question; www.blackwellpublishing.com/submit.asp?ref=0028-646X&site=1). We will return to this question of the most effective grammatical form for titles later.

*标题的目的是吸引特定目标受众中忙碌的读者，以便他们能够访问（下载）并阅读整个文档。你的标题越能揭示问题，你的潜在读者就越容易判断你的论文与他们的兴趣有多相关。为了证明这一问题的重要性，我们引用了相关的作者指南：*

*- 1.《生态学杂志》要求“一个简明且信息丰富的标题（尽可能简短）”（www.blackwellpublishing.com/submit.asp？ref=00022-0477&site=1）；*
*- 2.《新植物学家》规定了一个简洁而信息丰富的标题（对于研究论文，最好是陈述关键发现或提出问题；www.blackwellpublishing.com/submit.asp？ref=0028-646X&site=1）。我们稍后将回到标题最有效语法形式的问题。*

## 10.2 Strategy 2: Use keywords prominently|策略2：突出使用关键词

It is important to decide ==which words (keywords)== will capture the attention of readers likely to be interested in your paper and to place them near ==the front of== your title.

This practice also helps ensure that your title is picked up efficiently by ==the literature-scanning services==, which use a ==keywords system== to identify papers of interest to particular audiences. 

Wherever possible, it is a good idea to place the most important word(s) in your title in the position of power: ==the beginning==. For example:

*重要的是要确定哪些单词（关键词）会吸引可能对你的论文感兴趣的读者的注意力，并将它们放在标题的前面。这种做法也有助于确保文献扫描服务高效地获取您的标题，文献扫描服务使用关键字系统来识别特定读者感兴趣的论文。只要可能，最好将标题中最重要的单词放在权力的位置：开头。例如：*

- ✕ Effects of added calcium on salinity tolerance of tomato 
- ✓ Calcium addition improves salinity tolerance of tomato

- *✕ 添加钙对番茄耐盐性的影响*
- *✓ 钙的添加提高了番茄的耐盐性*

One effective way to ensure your keyword(s) are at the front of your title is to ==use a colon (:) or a dash (–) ==to separate **the first, keyword-containing part** of the title from a **second, explanatory section**. 

Effective examples include the following (taken from the reference lists of the Provided Example Articles [PEAs]):

*确保关键字位于标题前面的一个有效方法是使用冒号（：）或破折号（–）将包含标题部分的第一个关键字与第二个解释部分分开。有效的例子包括以下（摘自提供的范例文章[PEA]的参考列表）：*

>✓ Disturbance, invasion, and reinvasion: managing the weed-shaped hole in disturbed ecosystems干扰、入侵和再入侵：管理受干扰生态系统中杂草形状的洞

>✓ Native weeds and exotic plants: relationships to disturbance in mixed-grass prairie 本地杂草和外来植物：杂草草原干扰的关系

>✓ Methylamine/ammonium uptake systems in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: multiplicity and regulation 酿酒酵母的甲胺/铵摄取系统：多样性和调节

>✓ Resistance to infection with intra-cellular parasites – identification of a candidate gene 抗细胞内寄生虫感染——候选基因的鉴定

>✓ Mass flux measurements at active lava lakes: Implications for magma recycling 活动熔岩湖的质量通量测量：岩浆循环的意义

## 10.3 Strategy 3: Choose strategically: noun phrase, statement, or question?|策略3：策略选择：名词短语、陈述或问题

### 名词短语

The ==traditional way== to write titles and headings is as a ==noun phrase==: **a number of words clustered around one important “head” noun**. Below are some examples of this kind of title, with the head nouns shown in bold:

传统的写标题和标题的方式是作为名词短语：许多单词聚集在一个重要的“头”名词周围。以下是此类标题的一些示例，标题名词以粗体显示：

> **Diversity and invasibility** of southern Appalachian plant communities 阿巴拉契亚南部植物群落的多样性和入侵性

>Food expenditure **patterns** in urban and rural Indonesia 印度尼西亚城市和农村的食物支出模式

>**Systems** of weed control in peanuts 花生杂草控制系统DD大豆根瘤共生体对铁的吸收

>Iron **uptake** by symbiosomes from soybean root nodules 大豆根瘤共生体对铁的吸收

>**Evidence** of involvement of proteinaceous toxins from Pyrenophora teres in net blotch of barley大麦净斑病中除虫菊蛋白毒素参与的证据

*【优点】* Several of these titles are very effective: ==brief, informative, and with keywords placed near the front==. *其中有几个标题非常有效：简短、信息丰富，关键词放在前面。*

*【缺点】* However, this style of title writing is not always the best for meeting ==the two guidelines discussed under Strategies 1 and 2==. Look again at the last title in the list, “Evidence of involvement of proteinaceous toxins from Pyrenophora teres in net blotch of barley.” This title leaves us with an unanswered question: what kind of involvement? *然而，这种风格的标题并不总是满足策略1和策略2中讨论的两个准则的最佳方式。请再次查看列表中的最后一个标题，“大麦网斑中的除虫菊蛋白毒素的证据”。这个标题给我们留下了一个未回答的问题：什么样的参与？*

Additionally, the first four words are very general in meaning, ==giving no enticement== to the reader to continue reading.*此外，前四个单词的意思很一般，不吸引读者继续阅读。*

### 陈述句

*【优点】* Rewriting this title as ==a statement== could overcome these difficulties, and was in fact recommended by a referee when this paper was under review. (A statement is a sentence with a subject and a verb, and its ==advantage== in this context is that it can ==give more explicit information about the results== of the study.)

*将此标题改写为声明可以克服这些困难，事实上，在审查论文时，裁判建议了此标题。（陈述是一个带有主语和动词的句子，在这种情况下，它的优点是可以提供关于研究结果的更明确的信息。）*

>✕ Evidence of involvement of proteinaceous toxins from Pyrenophora teres in net blotch of barley 

>✓ Proteinaceous metabolites from Pyrenophora teres contribute to symptom development of barley net blotch (Sarpeleh et al 2007)

*【使用条件】* Statement titles are only suitable for papers that ==address a specific question== and ==present a non-complex answer==. In these conditions, the sentence form is a good option to ==replace titles that begin with vague terms== such as “The effects of….” For example:

*声明标题仅适用于==解决特定问题并给出非复杂答案==的论文。在这些条件下，句子形式是一个==好的选项替换以模糊术语开头的标题==，例如“……的影响”。例如：*

>✕ Effects of added calcium on salinity tolerance of tomato*添加钙对番茄耐盐性的影响*

>✓ Calcium addition improves salinity tolerance of tomato*钙的添加提高了番茄的耐盐性*

### 问题

*【使用条件】* When there is ==no simple answer== to be presented, it can be effective to write ==a title as a question,== e.g.*:如果没有简单的答案，可以将标题写成问题，例如：*

>✓ Which insect introductions succeed and which fail?哪些昆虫引进成功，哪些失败？

As with all sections of your manuscript, check whether the journal has ==specific conventions or recommendations== about the form of titles before you decide which form to use. In our own experience, it can be useful to develop a list of possible titles as you draft your manuscripts, and choose the most effective one for the target audience and the paper’s key message right at the end of the writing process.

*与手稿的所有部分一样，在决定使用哪种形式之前，请检查期刊是否有==关于标题形式的特定约定或建议==。根据我们自己的经验，在起草手稿时，制定一份可能的标题列表，并为目标读者和论文选择最有效的标题是很有用的关键信息。*

## 10.4 Strategy 4: Avoid ambiguity in noun phrases|避免名词短语中的歧义

*【歧义产生的原因】* If writers ==place a string of nouns and adjectives together==, to form a title which packs a lot of meaning into a few words, they can sometimes cause problems of ==ambiguity: more than one possible meaning==. *如果作者将一系列名词和形容词放在一起，形成一个标题，将大量的意思打包成几个词，有时会引起歧义：不止一个可能的意思。*

This is ==particularly the case when nouns are used as adjectives==, i.e. placed in front of the head word of the noun phrase. To investigate why this is so, let us consider some examples.

*当名词用作形容词时，尤其如此，即置于名词短语的首词前面。为了研究为什么会这样，让我们考虑一些例子。*

- germination conditions
- enzymatic activity suppression

The noun phrase germination conditions has only one possible meaning – conditions for germination – and thus it can be used without risk of ambiguity. Similarly, application rate can only mean the rate of application. 名词短语发芽条件只有一个可能的含义——发芽条件，因此可以在没有歧义的情况下使用。同样，应用率只能表示应用率

However, ==enzymatic activity suppression== could mean either suppression of enzymatic activity or suppression by enzymatic activity and is therefore ambiguous. 

。然而，酶活性抑制可能意味着抑制酶活性或通过酶活性进行抑制，因此不明确。

*【解决办法】* A general guideline is to ==restrict these noun phrases to a maximum of three words==, and this many only if there is no risk of misunderstanding. If they grow longer, rewrite them by ==inserting the prepositions that clarify the meaning== (e.g. of, by, for). For example:*一般准则是将这些名词短语限制为最多三个单词，只有在不存在误解风险的情况下才可以使用。如果它们变长了，可以通过插入介词来改写它们，以阐明其含义（例如，of、by、for）。例如：*

![[Pasted image 20221117101436.png]]

>✕ soybean seedling growth suppression大豆幼苗生长抑制
>✓ suppression of soybean seedling growth大豆幼苗生长抑制

*【注意】* N.B. ==When nouns are used as adjectives== in extended noun phrases, they are ==always used in the singular==. Useful examples to help you remember this are as follows:*当名词在扩展名词短语中用作形容词时，它们总是以单数形式使用。帮助您记住这一点的有用示例如下：*

- food for dogs → dog food 狗粮
- disturbance by herbivores 食草动物的干扰 → herbivore disturbance
- nodules on soybean roots → soybean root nodules 大豆根瘤

【名词修饰名词的好处】简洁
